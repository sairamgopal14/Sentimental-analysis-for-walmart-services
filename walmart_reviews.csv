Richard,37K reviews,US,2025-02-14T22:43:05.000Z,"Just when you thought Customer Disservice couldn't be worseI used to think it was a tie between AT&T and Comcast as to who had the worst Customer Disservice. That question is moot now, because the winner is Walmart. Foreign CD reps, an idiot chat bot, an exhausting telephone menu system bent on preventing access to a carbon life form, and an inscrutable web site designed by some executive's eighth grade computer nerd are all arrayed against you should you have a problem. If everything goes as planned -- which it never does -- then Walmart certainly is the place to shop if you're ok with grocery jumbo quantities which have a larger profit margin than smaller units. But woe unto you when things, like the best-laid plans of mice and men, go awry. The breathtaking incompetence of the people and the software of this organization strains one's credulity. You won't believe it until you experience it; withhold judgement until then.Date of experience:February 14, 2025",1
Ronald Mitzel,3.6K reviews,US,2025-02-14T06:03:30.000Z,"Worst delivery of any store in the United StatesI paid $12.95 a month for delivery service. Sometimes the delivery comes most times it doesn't. When it does come sometimes there's items missing. I call Walmart to tell them and they act like it's my fault they played the victim, because of their incompetent employees. I ordered lettuce recently and then let head of lettuce was black. It was rotted how dare they send that out to me. They take advantage of seniors especially who know that they can't get out to the store and have to depend on them. You have the lousiest delivery service in the United States of any other company I would rather pay $50 a month to have my groceries delivered and know that I'm going to get what I ordered I am done with you Walmart you are the absolute worstDate of experience:February 06, 2025",1

You know if you had more customer service in the store you could double your sales and the management would make more money and a bigger profit. Why don't management understand retailingPricing ,filling shelves çustomer service creates more money and double profits. It also stops shoplifting.

Scott Hauser,2reviews,US,2025-02-10T21:13:13.000Z,"Terrific Experience at Walmart Tire DeptWe arrived at 4:30 for our 5 o clock appt. We stood at the desk and waited 15 minutes before anyone came to help. After confirming our appt, they were unable to find the tires I ordered online. According to service tech, they should have been pulled earlier that day.Side note, there was only one other car in the bay with about 5 employees in the garage. They finally got my truck in at 5:30 to start the process. One employee would work on changing and balancing my tires as 3 would watch. One employee decided to start a boxing match with a pile of tires. I guess they don’t realize they are being watched through the glass.This process took over an hour and a half. After being told the truck was finished, they proceeded to tell us they needed to do a figure eight out in the parking lot. This meant they were going to perform cheerios in the parking lot with my vehicle. The employee attempted this while the others watched. He was able to do this  as my wife yelled “its in four wheel drive, please don’t do that. They just laughed. Not to mention, coming close to hitting other cars in the parking lot. I’m sure its on their security cameras.Date of experience:February 08, 2025",1

While they were able to deliver a mattress they could not find my apartment when it came to delivering a sofa bed I had ordered. They dropped it at a FedEx Office. I had to take multiple cabs to get the package from FedEx. My new apartment is on the 3rd floor. I then had to get it all the way up to my place. The box was damaged and torn from all four sides. I opened the box and my sofa bed was torn too. The fabric on the underside is torn! I was very upset and tried to get fair compensation for all this inconvenience caused to me by Walmart. I was put through a painful process of chatting with multiple associates over 6 hours. I can name them- Taha, Karim, Mohammad, Ejar, Chinthakindhi, Ruhina, and a few more. They offered me $20 as remedy! This amount doesn't even cover the cost of my cab fares. I am a loyal Walmart + member and this is how they treat me! In fact, after moving I also happened to visit a local Walmart store and get some more items! Guess what not only is the store dirty, unkempt, and unorganized, they are selling damaged defective goods. I purchased a set of night lights and one of them is broken! I will have to again take a cab and return it! I do not have a vehicle and all the business I am doing with Walmart is costing me more than it would probably at a Target or Amazon!

Used to like Walmart as a customers and used to percieve the company as one of HIGH QUALITY STANDARDS so I apply for a job there. To my surpprise this company have a very low quality standards for employees, they gave you training 10 times quarterly about policies to have a good work environment but they don't put what they teach you in action. Is very common see and hear how managers talk to employees in such a disrespectful way. Very important fact is that by many years many employees talked and reported reported to their HR department and corporate about the manager Leshawn at E Colonial Orlando, Fl, letting the company knows information about her continues abuses, micromanagement and disrespecful and bully behavior for over 30+ years against her employees and they KNOWS but NOBODY do or did anything. HR, the managers and directors of the store and region apparently fears her. Someone with high values and ethic standards, who cares aboit their employees and respect over everything and that believe in the company ""high ethic standards"" that they always are mentioning should investigate her very well before is too late, for the honor and reputation of the company and the daily suffering of my ex-coworkers that still there faihful to the company that are not hearing them.

Marco Marcoli,1review,US,2025-02-03T22:55:33.000Z,"I’ve been working at WalmartI’ve been working at Walmart in California for a while now, and overall, I think it’s a good place to work and shop. The stores have everything you need at affordable prices, and they always have good deals on groceries and household items.As an employee, the job can be busy and sometimes stressful, especially during holidays, but that’s normal in retail. The best part is the teamwork—most coworkers are friendly, and we help each other out. The pay is decent, and you get some benefits like discounts and PTO, which is nice.Customer service can be hit or miss, depending on the location, but that’s mostly because some stores are understaffed. The biggest issue is that sometimes management could listen more to employees and make schedules more flexible.Overall, Walmart is a solid place to shop and work if you know what to expect. Just be patient during peak hours, and you’ll find what you need at a good price!Date of experience:February 03, 2025",4
Jennifer Stogner,1review,US,2025-01-29T19:48:56.000Z,"Lost customer …I just went into Walmart after purchasing four brand new tires on Black Friday and I had a tire that was losing air. When I went in this morning to get it checked I was met by a woman. Her name was Karen who did everything correct in the beginning and became rude. As soon as she kept talking to me my tires were put on by this Walmart and I was told that everything was fine. When they took my tire off they said that I needed a new valve stem and said they did not have it in stock but then went to tell me that I needed a new valve stem which they did not have in but then said that I needed a new tire pressure sensor and they had that in stock which is the same thing as a new tire valve which I never understood and why was this not the same as when they put the tires on in the first place so not only did they have the sensor they could have put on when I got my tires put on but now I got charged extra for it as well as my tire being aired up. I am not happy at all and will never come back to this Walmart again for any of my tires. I felt the people that were helping me were rude and if this could have been fixed when I got my tires put on my car then why would I have to pay for it now?Date of experience:January 29, 2025",1

On Walmart’s platform, a mobile phone for the elderly, Artfone 4G with an SOS button is listed at an outrageous price of $999.99 USD.

Since working from home, I have been using delivery a lot. It takes them 10 business days to resolve pending charges. Instacart does this instantly. It’s one thing when the pending charge that needs to be adjusted is several cents or a few dollars it’s entirely another when it’s over $100. This is the third time this has happened where I placed an order for delivery it was unable to be delivered and then they held my money for two weeks. I will never use Walmart ever again.

My bank was like, Walmart knows exactly about this problem. Had no option but to cancel that debit card for fraud. Missing items, you have to call a different phone number so that's a hassle. But the final straw was last night, not sending a code to give driver and then they wouldn't let him deliver without me jumping through a bunch of hoops. At 9pm. He passed on my message to them I not only wasn't making any other arrangements for that order to be delivered, but canceling service altogether today. ""Customer service"" was fine with that. They've delivered so many times to me, this driver specifically, and neither of us could believe it. Later, I receive an email they are going to redeliver after 11p, per my request.

I literally thought they discontinued block cheese so they could sell shredded at a higher unit price. Then I saw the other cooler. And the check out lanes? Same as before not enough and some disabled self checks so the line extends over the hills and far away. One attendant to trouble shoot  10 kiosks.

Once again, an email arrives showing a box in front of a door. Once again, the same question is what I asked: WHOSE front door? Again, not mine, I assure you! NO DOOR APPEARS IN THE PHOTO AT ALL!There were six items. The email said that there were six, but photos of only four items were displayed. I then clicked on the See all items link to be able to review the entire list. Only one problem was discovered, though: clicking that link took me to a page that made no mention of the order at all! It’s as if the photo of the big box is going to give me what I needed from the six items that I never received!By now, while it would not surprise me if Walmart groans to learn that I have filed complaints about this shoddy service, I am 100% sure that the Better Business Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission probably have some special location in which they can preserve the huge stack of complaints that I file against Walmart.Only one problem: filing complaints doesn’t improve the service. NOTHING DOES!!! I figured that if I go to the store in person to shop, then at least if an item is out of stock, I can find a replacement. The subject of replacements is altogether a major reason for complaint as well, but one of the items that was in this last order was Neo Synephrine Nasal Spray.

However, the customer DOES deserve competent service. I truly have to ask: at whose door was that big box left? I checked my account with Walmart, and it has the correct apartment number, so how is it that it doesn’t make it to my door?I guess it’s a sign of aging that I cling to the silly notion that when I order something for home delivery, the item(s) in the order will arrive to my address. I guess that’s just one more concept that’s now where the Edsel is; again, it’s something that used to exist but is nowhere to be found now. I wish this was a skit on Saturday Night Live so I could turn it off and go on with my life, but when I order things that I definitely need for health reasons and then learn that they may have been left almost anywhere. The photo of the delivery made to someone else’s car must be what was the fate of that box of ordered items. The question is: how will I ever find out whose car it is and if that car is still anywhere near my home? I know, I ask for too much. Things like being able to order for home delivery and actually receiving what was ordered must be too sophisticated in this day and age, but this guy with the old-fashioned notion that placing an order should mean that the customer actually gets what he/she ordered must be from another planet because that sort of thing is ancient history already in modern-day America!Date of experience:January 25, 2025",1

Susan,2reviews,US,2025-01-03T04:03:30.000Z,"No warning about delayed delivery of shipped merchandiseWalmart is not telling people who order online that they are having delays in delivery with fedex for those selecting shipping on their orders. I ordered my dogs monthly supply of food thinking it would be here on time and as of now its nearly a week late leaving me having to buy additional bags of dog food while I wait for fed ex to deliver it using the only extra money I have for gas to get to doctors and the grocery store. When checking the tracking after the order was already in I find a disclaimer on FedEx website explaining the details of deliveries being late because of hurricane Helene and something else. Obviously this problem has been occurring for a few weeks already. What is the reason Walmart couldn't post a warning about the delays in the app or website so customers know what to expect ahead of time and can choose curbside pick-up or order from somewhere else if they need the items they are ordering without delay? Had it been posted in the Walmart app that they are experiencing delays in delivery I would have just gotten it curbside pickup. But it was not, therefore leaving me to wait indefinitely and costing me more money out of pocket than I can really afford to spare. There's still no date of when the package will arrive. FedEx says they will supply a delivery date when the package begins moving. So what if I run out of money and still dont have my dogs food? So much for being a Walmart plus member.Date of experience:January 02, 2025",1

Was even given 2 promo codes for $10 in which I couldn't even use for the order so I just took risk paid out of pocket. My order for canceled an hour before my local store closed.

Sometimes people actually just lose the receipt why cuz it got stuffed in a bag and got thrown away when you was unloading your things or for whatever reason.

I usually don't buy from them but they were the only place with the Nintendo switch package that contained MarioKart delux. When I got the the checkout page it kept changing the address to my boyfriends old address out in California. (I live in Pa). after changing it three times my address finally took and I placed the order, only to wake up the following day to find they were in fact, shipping all the items to California anyway! That's a 3000 mile mistake.I called in frantic and got a girl on the phone who assured me that the order was being cancelled and not to worry. She also said that this sometimes happen and to permanently delete any addresses that are not my own from my history which i did. That after noon I got a delivery receipt about the TV which my boyfriend fortunately was able to go and recover (he's military and was cleaning up a helicopter crash so I'm sure that was a great way to finish his day). I called in again and was assured again that nothing else was being shipped.The next day the accessory package showed up. I called in again... And so the cycle continues.I can not stress enough how much of a headache this has been. To make matters worse, even though we have returned the items and have the return slips as of 2 days ago I have yet to see my refund hit my account or receive a confirmation email from them. All this for an order that should have been cancelled or better yet, been shipped to the correct side of the country in the first place.They have not so much as offered me a free bottle of water for my or my boyfriends trouble.This place needs to get their act together.

I waited at least 30 minutes to be connected with a human messaging agent who assured me that my order will be delivered tonight. At 22h20, after waiting for another 30 minutes of the phone, I spoke to someone who said the driver canceled the delivery. She then supposedly reassign the delivery to another driver, but when I looked now, my goods were returned, whatever that means. I spent so much time chasing Walmart tonight. Their systems are not integrated. I cannot merely identify myself and provide full address for them to see the only order that was due for delivery today. Once I gave the order # they cannot see the status of the order, the agents disappear for a few minutes to try and find out what the hell is going on. They make promises that are not delivered. I asked the second agent what would have happened if I didn't call her tonight, and the answer was that I would not have received my order. She was very polite and obviously just the messenger. Walmart will assign someone tomorrow when it suits them. I have a house full of guest from tomorrow morning. This is such a shame. I tried to chat with them on Instagram before writing this review, but that is just a bot that is not trained to deal with any complex enquiry and wanted to connect me with a human, who I just spoke to and couldn't really help me. Walmarts logistics and systems are horrible. The website sends you in circles if you have a problem. There is no place where you can log a complaint.

I recently purchased a 10 CF freezer from Walmart, only to find out later that the vendor had been removed for being unreliable. Despite Walmart acknowledging this, their only solution was to offer a refund.I requested a replacement at the price I originally paid, but Walmart outright refused, leaving me without the product I needed and forcing me to start over elsewhere. Why should customers bear the burden of Walmart’s poor vendor oversight?This isn’t just about a freezer—it’s about the responsibility large retailers have to their customers. When companies like Walmart sell products, they are vouching for the quality and reliability of their vendors. Passing the blame and offering bare-minimum solutions isn’t good enough.Walmart, your customers deserve better.

I own 10 acres in north Florida and my hame is 1,000 feet from the public road. I have a good private road with a good turnaround point at my home. I drove a tractor trailer over the road for 30 years including with FedEx. Not once in my career did I leave a customers valuable merchandise at a gate or next to the road. My job was to deliver that merchandise to the receiver as that was my job and my responsibility to the shipper,receiver, and something called a work ethic that doesn't seem to be around anymore!I contacted the carriers ( FedEx and UPS) about my driver instructions to deliver my package to my door being ignored. I contacted walmart.com repeatedly with complaints. No change! I told Walmart com I would not order any merchandise through them any longer because of my merchandise being left at the gate or side of the road where it could be stolen rather than following my delivery instructions. I went back to Amazon who has their own fleet of delivery vehicles that do bring my merchandise at my requested delivery pointSo I thought I would do curbside pickup orders through Walmart com since I am picking up the merchandise.I had a toaster oven/ air fryer I purchased with my Chase credit card at Walmart com. I place 4 chicken legs with thighs attached in the air fryer over. This thing smoked like a 3 alarm fire! And it was 30* outside so I could open the windows! So I initiated a refund request explaining my reason. I was given a return with 2 options. Refund my $53.50 to my closed Chase credit card account ( I had a American Express card on file I had used since December) or a credit. So I saw only 1 option,the credit.I went to my favorite Walmart store in North Gainesville Florida to return the merchandise in the original box even. I requested cash or a in store credit. I was told they couldn't give me either. I was there to pickup $90 grocery curbside pickup. I called Walmart com on this Saturday and was connected to someone in another country. I explained my refund problem and was getting no where. I requested to speak to a supervisor. I explained my problem to the supervisor who got very frustrated with me a 69 year old man trying to get my own money returned as I had returned their faulty merchandise. I asked if she could put that $53.50 on a in store credit? She said yes to let her speak to the return person. I did and she and he revived his option given by walmart.com system. She was rude to him and talked down to him saying aren't you aware of this or that. And he replied that option wasn't available through the Walmart computer system. Finely I said I am here to pickup a $90 curbside groceries order can you apply that $53.50 to that order? She said no. I said can you cancel that order and apply the $53.50 and resubmit the order. She said I could do that but not her. And when I pointed out that this solution idea had come from me and not her, she got very upset and said no she had come up with this solution. So she canceled the order($90 grocery curbside pickup) for me.I didn't do that order again. I simply did my shopping.Later that night I thought I would do a walmart.com curbside pickup of another toaster oven/ air fryer. The payment options applied toward my purchase were the $53.50 refund and my America Express credit card on file that they had refused to post my $53.50 refund to that card. So I was going to go with these two payment methods to do the curbside pickup purchase. Then I saw a $2.90 charge! It had reasons including cancelation. Not happening!So Walmart.com is holding my refund of $53.50 hostage and allowing me only to spend MY MONEY how and where they will allow me to spend MY MONEY! And that being at walmart.com!I have had walmart.com in the past say I would receive MY REFUND MONEY when their outside vendor received their merchandise back. IN CHINA! I had to pay for my merchandise at purchase not when I received that merchandise! They want to hold YOUR MONEY until the merchandise is reviewed by the vendor because walmart.com has millions of customers world wide. Now if the can thousands or millions of CUSTOMER MONEY for saying 10 days. They are receiving thousands/millions of dollars of interest on OUR MONEY in THEIR BANK ACCOUNTS!I have had it! When I get MY MONEY back I will close my Walmart.com account!I have emailed President Trump about walmart.com holding MY MONEY hostage and TELLING ME WHERE I CAN SPEND MY REFUND MONEY! And I will be contacting the FTC today to make a complaint about all these hoops and this garbage I  a veteran and senior citizen am having to go through to get MY REFUND MONEY BACK!Walmart.com isn't my bank, credit Union,or credit card company and they don't have my permission to control or keep my refunded money on merchandise that has been returned to their Walmart store.Date of experience:January 24, 2025",1

Most of the employees, specifically 3 of the supervisors, I've encountered at various times of the day display facial expressions and body language as if it's a major inconvenience to have customers shop in their store. There's a short fear skinned female supervisor who wears a yellow vest, works at the self-checkouts. She chews gum annoyingly popping it continously while having the meanest look on her face. I noticed a customer asking her about a price signage that was different at the register. Thst supervisor seemed so disinterested in helping the customer that she looked at the (clothing) item and stated that the sign may have been. In the wrong place. I'd previously had a similar encounter with her as though helping customers would be too painful for her to do.There's a light-skinned male supervisor who'd previously was the produce supervisor. He has the absolute worse attitude when asking to have someone attend to an unattended area. He just walks off grumbling without saying yes or no. To my understanding, he's been promoted to a floor manager or another supervisor position.At various times when asking produce employees if there were more of a certain product 'in the back area,' they'll just say ""what we have out is all that we got."" I ask when they aren't busy. (They usually on their cellphones or talking with someone about non-work related matters.I understand the importance of having the Door Greeters upon entrance and exiting the stores but the Door Greeters in Laplace aren't too filriendly and in fact, perform visual scans of customers as if they all are criminals.There's 2 young females and a male who works in the Electronics area that has no sense of urgency when it comes to customer service. If I'm standing or walking having difficulty with searching for an item, I won't get any help from them via their initiatives. When they are approached to get help, they would rather point and verbalize directions instead of being proactive help out.I attend the pharmacy for prescriptions. I've had only one bad experience with manager as I was there to pick up a prescription for my wife following a recent surgery. Besides that incident, I think the pharmacy has GREAT employees who are consistently friendly, courteous and helpful. There are 3 young cashiers in the pharmacy and a elder lady who are outstanding. There's two Pharmacist (Jared and the (Asian) female who are difference makers. But the major difference maker is Megan, the Pharmacy Tech. Sharp, Intelligent, Caring, Diligent. Any questions or concerns I'd have with refills or authorizations, she was able to recognize and resolve it before I would arrive at the pharmacy.Date of experience:December 30, 2024",1

I've been struggling with finding a ride each month to get my groceries and sometimes I didn't have gas money for the people for the rides. So I figured I would finally break down and grocery shop online and get a ride scheduled for pickup at the Walmart closest to my house (35 miles away).WHY HAVEN'T I DONE THIS BEFORE?!?!It was so easy shopping online going through each brand on the shelves as if I was already there in person. Didn't have to worry about lines, didn't have to worry about people bumping into me AND Didn't have to worry about anxiety or fear of not having the food that I needed there. It was all online right in front of my face. AND they take FOOD STAMPS.I was in my pj's in bed with my tablet when I did it! It was a little nerve-wracking going to the pickup parking spot for the first time, not knowing if they would have been able to get it all the brands I wanted... BUT THEY NAILED IT!I'm so happy to say that I'll be doing this each month from now on.THANK YOU WALMARTDate of experience:January 12, 2025",5

However, my experience with this service has been fraught with challenges: late arrivals, missing items, wrong items, misdelivered orders, and even receiving damaged and moldy food items. With every issue I encountered, I diligently reported to Walmart. Despite these issues being no fault of my own, my online shopping privileges were unjustly revoked, suggesting that Walmart penalizes critiques more than it values customer satisfaction.Rather than restoring my privileges as promised, Walmart has kept me, a homebound individual wholly reliant on such services, cut off. I am not an isolated case. Many customers have met the same fate, with their stories echoing throughout various consumer forums.According to the 2020 Consumer Report on Retail/ Return-Fraud-and-Abuse, as many as 6.2% of consumers have experienced revoked shopping privileges following return policy abuse allegations—a serious concern when vast numbers of the population depends on these services.Date of experience:December 20, 2024",1

So, i contact support and talk with them and the tell me that after a few hours i can place the order again. I did this once and everything went fine i got my order delivered. Well, i placed another order yesterday and same thing after about 3-4 hours everything got canceled again. So, i contact support and they tell me the same thing after about an hour i can place the order and it will work. Ok fine, but the thing is that this time the money taken from my checking account for the order was never put back into my account. I called my bank and Walmart support back and forth staying on the phone between them for a good 3 hours. I talked to 3 different support agents from Walmart and all 3 told me something completely different. One said that it was a temporary hold on the money and is supposed to be released back to my account immediately, one said i had to contact my bank and give them a code to type in to release my money, and neither of those turned out to be true and my bank says that the money is still pending. So, the third agent tells me that it could be 7-10 business days before i get my money back. This is very unprofessional and unacceptable. So, all in all Walmart took my money out of my checking account and then canceled my order themselves, then tell me complete lies to get me off the phone with them i guess. So, i had to place the order again, and now I'm out double the money for what i needed and ordered and basically told i have to wait up until 10 business days before anything can be done about my money unless my bank says unless it goes from pending to complete and then i have to dispute it which could take up to another 30 days and then with me disputing it if i in fact have to go that route i risk losing my Walmart account as well. So, be very careful when ordering through them, I've already canceled my Walmart Plus and after i get this last order and my money back then i won't ever place another order through them again. I usually order through Amazon but ordering through Walmart.com i would get my order was faster which i needed this close to Christmas but its been a complete nightmare and this will be the last time i order anything else from Walmart.com again.Date of experience:December 23, 2024",1

Stanton Arch,2reviews,US,2025-01-10T11:46:41.000Z,"Customer service has seriously declined.So, I bought a large tv for Christmas on the 10th. For whatever reason they couldn’t get it to me until December 27th. I was okay with it because I’m traveling for Christmas, but I’ve got family arriving for new years. The whole time I’m checking the shipping status and it never changes. The 27th rolls around - nothing. I call. Apparently they forgot about me, and I bought it through a 3rd party even though I’m on Walmart website. Walmart chat doesn’t work for tracking issues, and I called 3 times to get an agent - they kept hanging up on me. Eventually I went to billing, now the chat works, I ended up getting $15 off my order.Now my order won’t arrive until January 6th - 12th. The 3rd party used AM transportation. I called them - they said it’s Walmart’s fault. Finally it’s shipping, arrives an 1hr1/2 from my home on 31st. Few days pass - call em - they need to send something to hub, uh duh, will call back. Never call back. Call again after a week for a schedule, they finally scheduled it for the 8th. Said they’d call. Neglecting to mention they’d also text and email so I didn’t need to leave my phone on which was very annoying. I confirm, they’re going to drop it off at front door. FINALLY it arrives, the 2 men need to test it. Neglected to mention that and I’ve got dogs, oh joy. So while they saved me a lot of work carrying it to the spot, I don’t like not being prepared. So, the tv is glorious, but the headache to get it was not. So I missed Christmas and new years, had far too many inconveniences, especially for how expensive it is.

Silver Parnell,12reviews,US,2024-12-29T01:50:17.000Z,"WALMART EMPLOYEES DO NOT SPEAK ENGLISHI live in New Mexico, which is a state in the USA. The official language in this state (and all the USA states) is ENGLISH, but you would never know it when ordering from Walmart because NONE of the shoppers or the delivery drivers speak any English AT ALL. Apparently, Walmart is only hiring people from Columbia and Mexico and South American Countries.  All the people in the phone banks, when you try to call WALMART.COM have extremely limited English. I think those people are in the Philippines. They barely understand you at all. MISTAKES ARE MULTIPLE, FREQUENT, CONSTANT AND INFURIATING. And when I ask to speak to a supervisor, I am told it will take 35 to 40 minutes before someone will come to the phone. It makes me feel like I have to tear my hair out. Even when WALMART sends me an email with a survey of my recent shopping experience, it is an awful experience. Recently, I was sent an email promising to enter me in the sweepstakes if I would just answer a few questions, so I did that, but at the end it somehow got the idea that I was an EMPLOYEE, so the automated questionnaire told me that I was not eligible for the contest to win one of the various sweepstakes cards because of the MISTAKEN IMPRESSION that I was supposedly an employee of Walmart (which I am NOT.) The FIRST agent I spoke to was clueless. He had a really hard time understanding what I was talking about. He made me wait forever and then told me that the email wasn't from them and it was a scam email (which is WASN'T. There is no way for a scammer to know what I ordered in my last Walmart order or that I had gotten a refund for a ham!) The man told me that he was going to report the email to somebody there, and he went on and on - but he was WRONG. It was one of Walmart's legitimate emails in response to a recent order of mine which NO ONE would know about unless they were from Walmart. (I get these emails after I place a delivery order lately, and I know they are legitimate.) Anyway, I asked to speak to a supervisor and he hung up on me. I called back, and the next agent didn't even know what a SWEEPSTAKES was. She had never heard the word before and you should have heard the way she pronounced it! I thought her tongue was going to get wrapped around her teeth and get bitten off! I endured this experience with her then finally asked her to please connect me with a supervisor and it took forever. THEN she told me it would be another 35 or 40 minutes before a supervisor would come on the line!  I finally gave up and hung up.  These language problems are not the only issues that we have with these people from foreign countries. Their understanding of HYGIENE is just terrible. The way they handle the fruits and vegetables is just awful, and half the time when they bring the groceries, they don't put everything in a bag and some of the food is just put down on the filthy sidewalk. I am disgusted with Walmart. Why don't you hire Americans who speak English? Charge a few extra pennies instead of driving your customers insane.Date of experience:December 28, 2024",1

Starting on Dec 29, at 2:19 received a notification that delivery was attempted.  I was home. My neighbor was washing her car. I have ring cameras  I was perplexed, looked at my cameras. Nobody had come asked my neighbor. Nope no one had been there. Reached out to Walmart.  Via your new chatting service.  They said they would attempt again today by 8:00 PM.  I waited. It never arrived. I waited.  I reached out through the chatting system again.  We are so sorry here’s a $15 credit.  Your item will be there by 10 PM. I waited again.  It did not arrive.  The next day I reached out again I had someone call me.  Obviously from another country.  Through this whole ordeal, I’ve been dealing with customer service and another country.  I’ve been told the item was canceled.  So I immediately ordered another item.  That was not the truth. The item wasn’t canceled.  And no item arrived.  I tried to call Walmart itself, which is a mile and a half down the road. No one answered.  So I have two charges of $105 each.  No toolbox.  And then I call again.  We are so sorry we learned the reason it wasn’t delivered. Is because the driver learned that the item was damaged and returned it to the store.  That was on 29 December.  Since then, I’ve placed three orders.  I’m taking the time out of my life to write this because currently as we speak since December 29, Walmart has over $300 of my funds pending three toolboxes that I’ve paid for and no one can answer me honestly when at least one of these will arrive.  I called the store today because someone at the store should know there’s three toolboxes that should be delivered to my address.  I gave the order number to a girl that actually answered the phone at the Walmart itself who checked with her manager, who was supposed to call me back by 4 o’clock.  There’s no phone call.  There’s no toolbox.  But I do know I have over $300 out of my bank account right now and I have no earthly idea when this product will arrive because they lie and they keep saying it’ll be here today and then they say oh it was a problem so then I order another one hoping it’ll be delivered. You guys should really have it set up where you can talk to somebody that is in blowing smoke up your bottom saying oh we’re so sorry we’re so sorry    Where is the toolbox?    When will you cancel the other two items?  When will you release my money?  On December 29 I placed a delivery order for one toolbox.   Y’all have messed up do you even know I’m one of your biggest customers I’m not even kidding. I place orders a few times a week and at this point I’m not gonna place another order until you either deliver that toolbox or give me my money back I’d prefer the toolbox. That was the whole intention here I could’ve gone on Amazon. I could’ve had a toolbox five days agoDate of experience:December 29, 2024",1

I have had THE most disgusting experience with Walmart.com and it has completely ruined my kids Christmas.  I ordered an item through the app last week. When I get to store #1, they say the item had been cancelled, no big deal, it's a little over a week from Christmas. I spent several days looking for the item, I found it on the morning of December 23rd,  the app showed me store #2, which is 30mins away, that said they had 7 available and pick up would be between 9pm and 10pm. I ordered and paid for the item. I received a text message at 9:45pm saying they were out of stock and if I responded by 2pm they could have it shipped to me by January 6th. How am I supposed to respond to a message by 2pm.....at 945pm?   I called customer service and told them this was completely unacceptable because I had already paid for it 2x, have yet to receive a refund for the 1st purchase, was promised a pick up time between 9 and 10pm for the 2nd time I've paid for the item and at this point needed it shipped overnight to my home.  The associated told me she could see on her end that the item was scheduled to be delivered the next day, December 24th.  I asked if she were sure, because that's not what my message is saying on my end. She said yes. I asked to speak to a supervisor, the supervisor said the same thing, it will be AT my home by 10pm on December 24th.  December 24th, it's not there. I called once, spoke to a supervisor, he said to please give it more time since it wasn't quite 10pm yet but it was on it's way.  I called again around midnight because I still didn't have the item.  I spoke to yet ANOTHER supervisor who apologized because the item wasn't going to be delivered that night, stating the driver had an ""emergency"".  He said it WILL be delivered by 9pm on the 25th (following day).  I asked if he were sure because no one delivers on Christmas day. He assured me it would be there and asked me to have patience.  December 25th, still no package, so I called AGAIN, got another supervisor who apologized, saying they don't deliver on Christmas day. Oh really because that's what I said on the 24th and was promised that WASN'T the case!!! He also asked me to have patience and it will be delivered on the 26th. I told him that was bullshit because it's now AFTER Christmas, they can see where I have called MULTIPLE times and I have the chats where I have spoken to MULTIPLE people and have been lied to multiple times.  He offered me a $10 promo code......no, I want my item. It was at that point I was told since my item hadn't been delivered yet and they really had no idea where it was, to go to store #2, talk to the store manager and they would give me one off the shelf.  Again, I asked if they were sure because I didn't see how that would work. I was assured ""it will be ok and taken care of"". I asked for this in writing, I was told it would be ""put in my file"".  I call the store today to let them know I was on the way, they hav no idea what I'm talking about and see nothing there with my name on it. I told them customer service said it would be in my file, the store said there are no files and for me to call customer service back......I call them back, was put on hold for 1 hr and 8mins and then hung up on. In that time, I was able to physically drive to store #3, which is closer to my houses, ask for THEIR store manager, explained to him what was going on and he said I had to drive to store #2 because that's who was supposed to be delivering my order to begin with. I drive the 30mins to store #2 even though I had spoken to them over the phone and they claimed they had no idea what I was talking about, talked directly to that store manager, was told they see my online order but cannot give me one off the shelf because walmart.com and the physical stores are ""separate"".  They can see all of the times I called customer service, they can see all of the delays in shipping but claim there was nothing they could do and advised me to call customer service back. I called customer service back AGAIN, only to be told all they could do was give me a $15 promo code via email for my inconvenience and suggest I cancel (an order I never got) and reorder it........so, at this point, I have no item, no refund, no money but I do have a $15 promo code for an online purchase, so I guess that accounts for the damn near $700 Walmart has.

Michelle Nix,1review,US,2025-01-03T16:04:17.000Z,"Walmart Location Comparison, there is no comparison!Real Quick: The no sugar added Klondike bars are a must try, as is the Cherry Pepsi Zero, the best zero soft drink I've ever had. This rating is a comparison of the walmart I used for the past year in Arlington, TX (which I will refer to as WMA), across from Att stadium, & the one I recently switched to in Grand Prairie, TX (which I'll abbreviate to WMG) next to the Premium Outlets Mall, regarding Online Grocery Pickup. WMG is a much better location to do my ""OGP"".1. WMG : Fills orders w/ care, with little wait time, when checked in.  @WMA I had to wait out in my car forever b4my order was brought those 60 feet to he car. The employees were always on their cell phones, wearing headphones, flirting w/one another while loading orders in trunks, (or all of the above), they're consistent in being unprofessional, even careless @ times. Worried about the wrong things at work.2. WMG is eager to be of assistance, alert, prompt, and friendly.WMA, goes without saying.3.WMG is flexible. ex. Yesterday I accidentally went to the Sam's next door and waited in their OGP area, it's right next door to WMG, & the pick up zone is on the side of the store. Almost hqIDENTICAL to WMG OGP zone. Both are right next to an auto care garage too, further confusing the situation. In my defense, It was dark & I entered via the street behind the store, & there were WalMart trucks parked @ Sam's docks. I waited like 30 minutes before I sensed something was off. I chkd my order status and it was marked ""PICKED UP"". So, I reached out by chat 1st, then I called & was advised flag down an associate.Who informed me at that time that I was at the wrong building! He said it happens a lot.im not real farmiliar w/ that area. But even after I was an hour late to the right place to pick up my order, a young man at WMG promptly helped me and brought my groceries out within minutes, as if i was not even late at all. Order was ACCURATE! & he was not concerned aboutyextreme tardinessI waš once ""late"" to my pick up at WMA and was cut off from the ""Ive parked button"" so I had to wait until the next day! But I hit the parked button at the last minute, so technically I wasn't late, but that's just how lazy WMA OGP is, the option vanished when i hit enter. I was there, but sent away because it was 4:59, even though my time was till 5. Zero Flexibility.Also, WMA is unwilling to work w/ppl in a flexible manner, they refuse. So, each time I called about a problem, which was every time I went, they would just refund stuff left and right instead of being proactive, just so they didn't have to search for a better solution. They refunded my entire $150 order(AFTER  I ALREADY GOT IT) because I called to complain about old nasty produce, because they gave me trash. Mngmnt opted out of prob solving, & all I asked was for someone to fix it so I wld get what I paid for, I didn't think I should have to go back to the store and go through all that rigamarole for their carelessness. And I literally live across the street from WMA, someone could have just ran it over and not even messed with driving. Thats right, the manager refunded my entire order over 3 vegetables. Talk about a corporate liability. I once got a broken egg, that time, instead of refunding me the $4, they told me to bring the eggs back, go in, and prove 1 egg was broken? For $4? I would've had I been immediately advised to do so while submitting the online complaint, instead I got a separate email, later, advising the egg be returned first, AFTER they informed me I was ""all set"" & ""no further action was needed"" from me, it even said my ""refund is being processed"". So I made the eggs and disposed of the unusable 1 in the trash. But seriously? U want proof for $4? A bit inconsistent, what kind of place refunds $150 over a bell pepper & just takes my word for it but needs me 2 bring a broken shell for a $4 one?It never failed, itbwas always a hassle to do OGP at that WM. I really think most of it was done purposely. Like moldy peppers, vermen-chewed carrots,etc the bag was open & spilling & chewed carrot pcs n bag, egg was squeezed between 2 fingers.Customer Svc began to act as if they thought I was scamming.  Because MNGMNT & CS agents over-compensated ME? IT WASN'T ME, IT WAS THEM! THAT'S WHY I SWITCHED STORES. It is POSSIBLE NEW MNGMNT IS IN ORDER at WMA. Employee CONSEQUENCES also.And PROPER TRAINING. QC before sending orders out. INVESTIGATE complaints! They tell a lot. Customer is right, even if they're not, that policy cuts down liability, believe it or not. Managers and supervisors should work harder than everone else, not less. The laziness erks me to no end.Date of experience:January 01, 2025",5

I am EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN WALMART AND THE SELLER, LZBEITEM. The seller of the greenhouse uses inferior hardware, i.e. nuts and bolts, which rust after a couple months, but you only have 30 days for this seller to stand by the product. Walmart will stand by the product a bit longer, but not long enough for the serious problems with the product to become evident.  I have spoken with several Walmart customer representatives, both in online chat and on the phone.  I have been lied to by most of them, especially the one who told me he had the seller removed from Walmart.  Along with the inferior hardware, you'll also need to spend about $100 for caulking the window panes in place while putting the greenhouse together, and another $50-$100 to build a foundation on which to set the greenhouse, which is not clearly stated in the instructions.  I need someone who is willing to HELP RECTIFY the problems with the inferior product this SELLER AND WALMART IS SELLING.  Can someone contact me from Walmart who is honestly willing and able to help me?

I put in an order for 4 items: Vitamin D3. Toilet Paper, Aspirin & some Eddie Bauer jeans that were on sale for really cheap. The order was broken up into 3 packages by them. The D3 all by itself, the toilet paper & aspirin together & the pants coming later from an independent seller via Walmart. The first 3 items were same day delivery. The vitamins came. The TP & aspirin were supposed to show up later on by 9PM at the latest. At 5:30 PM I got a notification that they would arrive by 2:45 Pm which had long passed! Then an hour later I got a notification that the package had been delivered...but it had not been delivered. I went to bed and in the morning it said that my package had now been delayed. Another 3 days passed and then they cancelled that part of the order & it said that it would take up to 10 days to get my refund. 11 days had passed as of today. I called my bank & they said that they had received NOTHING from Walmart! I called Walmart customer service and the guy told me after 20 minutes on the phone that the refund had not yet even been started! He said it would now take another 48 hours to begin the process & then the standard 10 days. So, in total, 23 days to get a $17 refund for an order that they cancelled. they had told me when I called after they had suddenly cancelled that the driver had flipped out on the job or something. The guy that I talked to today was the only decent person over the entire experience. My takeaway was that they could care less about their customers! I will never order anything from them online again. This was the crappiest customer service that I have ever encountered in my entire life and I am 68 years old!

B.F.,97reviews,US,2024-12-21T00:46:25.000Z,"Walmart+ misleading and not flexibleI appreciate Walmart and Walmart+ for a variety of things, but find two things very troubling: misleading delivery times and a complete lack of flexibility to add to an order before and during shopping- something all other equivalent services offer. To lure in orders, banners say ""Place this order by (x) time and get you delivery free by (y) time, but when you go to review the order minutes- or even seconds later- the delivery time shifts to hours later than quoted, and usually only reflects this after placing the order. This happens with every order. Also, when placing an order, starting shortly before shopping items cannot be added without additional fees, charges, more charges on top of those fees, and fees on top of the charges, not to mention an additional tip for a separate delivery. The app and website allowing chatting with a shopper, but it doesn't allow for them to just add it, and unless the extra order is already placed, the shopper cannot wait for another one to be placed. Walmart offers to refund some of the fees, but the tip has to stay in order to be fair to the delivery person who makes the extra trip. Considering I can't find any other service that doesn't allow such an option, this is a huge disservice to customers.Date of experience:December 20, 2024",2

I went to the front of the store for a Manager there was no one available. I found a Supervisor Rosaria and she was no help. She kept saying someone will come and looked around and could not locate anyone.  I spoke to 4 Walmart Associates however they could not speak English. After 45-50 minutes someone came and finally assisted me.  They said they had to give the item to a cashier. I was instructed to go to cashier 8 her name was Hina or 10 however when I got there the Supervisor never gave either of them the eye drops (Thera Tear).  At this point I was so upset and tired I just left.  I will never shop at this store again.  I called the store when I got home 732-826-4652 I tried to reach several departments for over 2 hours and no one picked up the phone.  The store Manager David listed on the receipt is non-existent.

He says... we cant fill your tires up to the vehicle specifications because our machines only let us do 60psi. Walk up to customer service and finally get the attention of the female employees standing with their back to me. Pay for the invoice.

It was concluded by he tech that it was most likely the blanket.Mainstays( a Walmart private brand) customer service number I have noted: 1-866-321-9509I was given specific instruction by Othman with an incident number of 241122-66184-0346-00001.  Go to the San Leandro Walmart on Davis Street.  I asked if I could mail it back instead and I was told no, that I had to go to a physical store.2,  Ask for the store manager who can start the warranty paperwork.Per my notes from that day of November 20,2024 1237 as documented on my iPhone.I was told by LaToya, last names are not given in the Store nor on the telpehone, that she did not know why I was sent into the store but they only issue 90 day returns there and I had been more than that.  I took my blanket and returned home.  I then got a call 1 week later from her but when I tried to return the call daily for about a week  NO person answered at the Davis St.  location until I pressed the option for pharmacy... lot's of details omitted here but I was told he would get a message to the manager.Lastly, I don't drive so every time I have to go into the store it is by the grace of a fiend or by public transportation which is a multi-hour ordeal. So, this last time was the most dismissive and disrespectful interaction. with a manager at the store by the name of Erica after I told the Team Lead my story to get her permission to speak with the manager.Part of the timeline that is significant here is that on another attempt after being sent away by Latoya *the first manager I spoke with, I called the online customer service which offered to refund me my purchase price of the blanket but I did not get what it cost me but only half  and not the shipping costs, or the warranty cost.I want a FULL refundDate of experience:November 19, 2024",1

They charged my card twice, cancelled the order twice, made me call them twice and made me drive to the store for nothing and now I have to wait for my bank to credit the refund plus I wasted the whole week waiting for the tires.  This is only one of many many shitty things they’ve done to me and I’m sure to many other people on a daily basis.We don’t do anything and the experiences we shared don’t really matter, what really matters  are the tons of money they’re making regardless.I’ve told Aldi’s employees when I see them working that one of them is more efficient than 3 of Walmart employees combined.For starters Walmart needs to teach their employees the very basics of customer service.Date of experience:December 03, 2024",1

Put me on hold and said no supervisor is available,  I need to call back later. Call back!! Now I am even more upset.  I said I will sit and wait until a supervisor comes online.  I was hung up on.

I don't have one on my account, and the order details where they tell you to get the passcode didn't list one.I called Walmart support, their stupid AI phone system only gives you 5 different choices to choose from, none of them relate to my situation, and no matter what I said, their system would just repeat ""I'm sorry, can you say that again?"". They make it IMPOSSIBLE to reach a live person, and after wasting 30 minutes trying to get a live person and failing each time, the driver took my delivery back with him so now I have no groceries and tons of frustration.I called the store, no one answered, and it's the second time I needed assistance since they've been opened, and the second time their phone just rang and rang.I want to like this location since it's conveniently close, but their processes are terrible and useless and they make reaching a live person to get assistance impossible.

My Black Friday order was unfortunately canceled due to a communication issue with the driver. While I understand that mistakes happen, the driver wasn't able to speak English, which made it impossible to resolve the problem at the time of delivery.This resulted in the cancellation of my order and a $10 gift card as compensation. However, the items I wanted are now out of stock and more expensive. The $10 doesn't cover the price difference, leaving me frustrated and unable to take advantage of the Black Friday savings.As a large and respected company like Walmart, I believe ensuring clear communication between drivers and customers is crucial. Perhaps implementing additional training for delivery personnel or prioritizing bilingual drivers in certain areas could be helpful.While I'm disappointed along with my wife with this experience, I have had positive experiences with other companies like Amazon.Overall, I hope Walmart can improve their delivery communication practices to avoid similar situations in the future.Date of experience:November 30, 2024",1

Both orders would end up being horribly wrong and result in nearly two hours of chats and phone calls to come to a resolution which - in bad faith - Walmart would NOT follow through with.The order ending 1421 was not shipped, but instead dropped off from a local store on my side porch (as delivery instructions indicate).  The items received were not my order at all.  The order ending 8682 was to be delivered (as I get free delivery with Walmart+) from the store and ended up being completely wrong.  The driver - who I was forced to tip -left the order roughly a block away on a different street.  Only four of the items in the order were present, and were not delivered to my home - I had to try to deduce from a photograph where the driver left the items.I took to the online chat for assistance, but was told to call in.  The online system wouldn’t recognize my phone number, despite Walmart texting this number MULTIPLE times throughout my experience as a customer.  I had two phone calls with their off shore customer service - one including a 37 minute wait for a supervisor. - which ended with an offer to refund the orders and give me a $15 gift card.Walmart never followed through with their promise, and would end up emailing me on Nov 25, 2024 telling me the order FROM THEIR DRIVER was shown as delivered and to click the link on my account for a tracking number and information.  They further encouraged me to take up the matter with my bank.This is just the most recent in a long string of missed orders, and fraudulent promises of “Walmart Cash” and other advertised opportunities.

Traditionally, the customer is always right, and employees are expected to be courteous and respectful. However, these employees were simply dreadful. I'm not claiming we were faultless, but their behavior was utterly unprofessional, even threatening to call security and force us to leave, which was unwarranted. I admit I responded rudely, but I did not raise my voice as they did. Open more regular registers, which would provide jobs and reduce reliance on self-checkouts, might improve the situation. As we were finishing, they shut down three self-checkouts, despite it being hours before closing time when it usually gets busier. It's better to employ people who appreciate their jobs and understand that working with the public means dealing with difficult individuals, but the way we were treated was unacceptable. Frankly, Walmart in Salisbury, NC has lost my business. I'll choose Food Lion or another store instead and am changing pharmacies due to similar issues with rudeness and disrespect.

Tired of dealing with their constant issues so i'll happily take my business elsewhere- Buyer Beware.Date of experience:November 12, 2024",1

I was charged $120.00 above the listed price online.  I called the customer service number and spoke with Subhan.  He told me that he was not able to adjust the price last night.  He told me that the card was not charged until I had the tires installed.  I had an appointment to get the tires installed today at 6:00pm. He told me to call him back when the tires were installed and that he would adjust the price.  This is where the terrible experience begins.  I was not able to speak with Subhan.  I spoke with several Walmart customer service representatives and managers.  They all told me that they were unable to do anything to rectify the problem.  They said that there was nothing that they could do. This is unacceptable.  I would have cancelled the order yesterday if I knew that this was going to happen.  I went on the word and advice of one of their customer service representatives.  This should be downright embarrassing for Walmart. Walmart is a 684 billion dollar company.  They are  putting their reputation on the line for a 120.00 dollars.  It just doesn't make sense.  I feel like I have been robbed of my hard earned money. I expected much more from the customer service of a multibillion dollar company.  I am greatly disappointed and will no longer shop at Walmart.

I asked if I could get the vacuum for 198.00 due to the stores error of vacuum they don’t even carry anymore on shelf. (Showing specs of old vacuum with new vacuum displayed on top of it. No other label for the new vacuum) He said he couldn’t discount or give me that price at all. Was very rude and did not care about my concerns.

KK,14K reviews,US,2024-11-04T00:56:54.000Z,"TodayToday, I endured a distressing incident at Walmart / Lawrenceville-Suwanee Rd. While buying items totaling around $470.00, including a Keurig coffee maker, several shelving liners, coffee creamers, groceries, and more, I was forced to use the self-checkout due to a lack of staff. I usually avoid self-checkout because of the confined space, but today, there were no alternatives.As I scanned items, especially multiples of the same product, the screen kept beeping and showed ""assistance required."" I checked with a nearby Walmart employee, who assured me everything was fine and reset the screen. Nonetheless, some items, like a 12-pack of Coke under my cart, two shelving liners, and a toilet brush cleaner without a barcode, didn't scan properly. My requests for help were ignored by the employee.Upon finishing my purchase and payment, security stopped me at the entrance, claiming I had not scanned several items. This led to a shocking and humiliating ordeal. I was taken to a room and treated as if I were a criminal, while my 82-year-old mother and sister were left exposed to public judgment at the entrance. The staff's lack of respect and empathy was appalling.Reviewing the security footage, which clearly showed my efforts to scan every item, did not change their treatment of me. The malfunctioning screen and alerts should have led to proper assistance, but it was neglected. Consequently, I found myself isolated in a room, defenseless, while officers and staff joked around. I believe I faced discrimination and racial bias.I have now been banned from Walmart and any associated locations for the next two years. This entire ordeal has left me mentally and physically distressed. I intend to pursue legal action for this mistreatment and seek justice for the humiliation and emotional pain caused. No one should have to endure such treatment over an honest mistake. Treating people as criminals without due cause is unacceptable.

Flashercat DK,6reviews,CA,2024-11-02T05:52:21.000Z,"Walmart Online ordering service bad business practicesSeveral times Walmart Canada Online have cancelled an order on me. This is bad business practices.Walmart Canada online should not be allowed to sell items online to customers if they can not follow through with the order.  Walmart Online system does know how many items are in stock and how many been sold so why are employees from the online customer service lying to customers.  An employee puts inventory stock amount into the system lets do an example: A piece of furniture (Computer Desk, TV stand, Dinning Table, etc) there is a total of 20 items of that one type of furniture available for sale this amount ""20"" is entered into the IN-STOCK system, as each item is sold the number in the inventory system decreases to only show the remaining amount of items left in-stock. As long as items are in stock a customer can purchase the item online. Once the system reaches ""0"" (ZERO) meaning no more items left in stock the system will shut off (remove) the +add purchase option feature on that item page and it will say ""out of stock"". Meaning customers will NOT be able to order it anymore.What has been happening is every time I purchased an item online Oct 25, 2024 it clearly said it""4 IN-STOCK"" then I click the +add feature and go to check out cart and purchase the item.It gave me a Confirmation number # and it said your order going to be delivered on ""October 31, 2024""October 31, 2024 NOTHING arrives, checked my online account it still says it shipped it out, I called 1-800-328-0402 to find out what is going on and I was told by the Online Walmart Canada employee that my order is now on back order and there is a small delay. The walmart employee says to me ""you will receive your item in 3 days"".The next day I received an email from Walmart online saying ""your order has been cancelled.""I called back 1-800-328-0402 spoke to another Walmart employee who says the order is cancelled because it is out-of-stock and when it comes back in stock I would have to reorder the item and pay the regular price of the item since the sale is over.There is no way a customer should be having to go through this nonsense.Walmart system said the item was in-stock and allowed the customer to order the item, from that moment that item was promised to that buyer and should had been set aside for that buyer and not given to someone else.It seems like Walmart doesn't care about it's bad business practices and for that reason Walmart shouldn't be allowed to sell items online if they can not follow through with the orders to customers because it is false advertising what they been doing. The moment they gave a person the confirmation number that was an agreement that the item they had order was promised to be provided and sold only to them and not to someone else.So how did my item mysterious disappear and became back order 6 days later? It was In-Stock when it was ordered so it makes no sense as to why Walmart keeps doing this to me or is it because they don't want to sell it at the sale price they had advertised when I purchased it online.This happened to me several times on different furniture orders.The employees are misleading customers lying to them when they inquire about their purchase they made online which providing misinformation lying to customers should had been grounds for dismissal, the system needs to be checked to ensure it is not glitched which because it has happened to me several times I serious doubt it was, which leads me to believe the employees are messing around with customers orders and giving the items to others or etc.I can understand it happening once maybe twice but NOT almost every time I ordered online furniture items off of the Walmart Canada online website.Walmart Canada online needs to honor it's products it offers online for sale otherwise they shouldn't be in the online business. It is companies like them that ruin the industry for businesses.Do better Walmart if you can not guarantee the item that you said was IN-STOCK online when customers placed the order then you shouldn't be allowed to sell items online anymore.Date of experience:November 01, 2024",1

Jake Thurman,1review,US,2024-11-01T04:03:54.000Z,"Personal DataThis is about my online account with Walmart. I noticed others are experiencing the same problems that I've listed and I've contacted Walmart several times through chat, phone and feedback. Nothing has been resolved as of today's date.Apparently, Walmart has changed the layout of their website again, and again without notifying account holders.Previously, Walmart would save your in-store purchases along with the receipts so you could go back, if need be, to look up items you purchased or retrieve a receipt if necessary. This was great and very useful. They would also keep a list of protection plans that you purchased that covered the items you purchased. All this was so convenient and I trusted Walmart to keep my information safe and secure.For the past 2 months, I'm no longer able to find the items I purchased in-store and that had been usually listed in my purchases, nor their respective receipts. They offer a tool to recover these receipts but you need the information from the receipt to look it up. It's not that useful.On October 24, 2024, I was able to save the items and receipt to my Walmart account but only after manually entering my phone number at the self checkout. I've never had to do this before and won't be doing it anymore. Previously, the payment methods associated with my account were used to keep these purchases listed as long as I used those payment methods when making a purchase.Also, I had several protection plans listed before and now only one is listed. Several were still active but if I ever needed to make a claim, I would need the receipt. Even if I had the original receipt, it would be faded by now because of the type of thermal paper it's printed on. That's one of the reasons I was happy to rely on Walmart to keep these receipts. It was definitely a great idea and service Walmart provided.When I've tried to search for items that I've purchased in my purchases, nothing even remotely similar is returned in the results. Whether you use the exact name of the item, the brand, a general term, nothing like it shows up in the results. The website indicates I can go as far back as 2021 to find purchases. When I continue to search for previous purchases, the Walmart website repeatedly asks me to signin again to do the search. This happens each time I attempt a search in previous purchases.Additionally, WalMart offerers the option to request your personal data. I assumed I could get the information I wanted from the information they would send me. When I requested the information, Walmart said it wasn't available in my State. I don't understand why it matters which State I live in to get my personal data.I like Walmart very much and they come up with innovative ways to help the customers. But, when those methods that are so important where it offers protection to the consumer and it's taken away, it becomes a serious breach of trust.Whether it's a glitch in their website or they intentionally removed these services, I hope Walmart fixes it and brings them back and provides the information I want.Date of experience:October 31, 2024",2

michelle naylor,1review,US,2024-10-31T20:35:20.000Z,"Where is Nick? Harvard Illinois ManagerOn Tuesday, October 29th, I went to the Walmart store(1211) to buy groceries and a bottle of Advil because I had a bad toothache. I left the store, came home, and noticed that the bottle of Advil was not in any of my bags. On several occasions, I have left the store without getting all my bags; it was usually my fault. So, I called the store to see if I left the Advil at the registrar.   The same cashier who checked me out answered the phone, and she became very defensive and argumentative and said she did not make a mistake. I never accused her of making a mistake; it would have been my fault if I left the bag. I was just calling to see if it was found. She insinuated that I was lying and implied that I just wanted to get a free bottle of Advil.   In other words, I had a scheme to drive miles to Walmart to buy dinner and a small bottle of Advil, then drive home. Then I called the store and lied that the Advil was not in my bags. So, I can drive miles back to Walmart for a free $4 bottle of Advil?   I was very insulted by this. Then I asked to speak with the manager Nick, whose name is on the receipt.  She refused to let me speak to the manager, claiming she was the manager, and her name was Jill. I did not believe her.  I called the Walmart corporate office and left word that I wished for the store manager to call me since I was not allowed by ‘Jill, the new manager’ to talk to him. I was told by the corporate office he would call or email me that day.It is now Thursday and I have never heard from him. Harvard, of course, is a rather small town with the nearest grocery store about 20 minutes away.  So, we buy all our groceries here. I visit this store more than 3 to 5 days a week. For our family, I estimate we spend anywhere from $400 to $600 per month at this store just on groceries.   That does not even include prescriptions,  small appliances and home decor.  Not to mention, my daughter owns an eBay and an Etsy store and sells a large amount of dinnerware and home decor.  She buys almost all of her boxes, bubble wrap, packing tape, and other items for her business here. I did her taxes last year, and she spent well over $ 3,000 last year at this store alone for her supplies. So, I feel it is inexcusable that the manager Nick cannot take five minutes of his time to call me back. I will be writing a letter to the corporate office today, so maybe they can explain why Nick blew me off.Date of experience:October 29, 2024",1

Being a bachelor, groceries are not a priority. His pantry was basically empty.  So I thought….. I’ll order from Walmart and have them ship it to me.  I ordered over $300 worth of groceries.  Nothing perishable, Nor were there any specialty items.  They have trickled my order in, 1 to 2 items, no more than three items at a time. It has taken them over a week. It’s going on about eight days now, To receive one order. They have pushed order dates back…..seriously I received (2) boxes today; 10/30/24, with one item in each box.  I logged into their helpline to have a text conversation with a tech, To no avail.  By the time all of the groceries are here I will have left. I would never order shipping groceries from Walmart.  This has been absolutely ridiculous.  I had them shipped because I’m 45 minutes away from the nearest Walmart.  It would have been worth it, to have picked them up.

Allison Reeder,14K reviews,US,2024-10-28T22:27:07.000Z,"On my way home from my son's house…On my way home from my son's house about a week ago I decided to stop at the Walmart on Sheridan Blvd. in Westminster, CO to get some groceries. I spent about an hour to an hour and a half selecting items. The total at checkout was around $135. I use my bank card to pay for almost everything. Recently the strip on my card has become a bit worn and sometimes doesn't work, so I always pay by tapping, which works fine. When I tried to pay at the Walmart checkout the cashier told me I had to swipe the card. I told him this wouldn't work, but he then told me I had to try swiping three times. Weird. I did as he asked, thinking that this might trigger my bank to freeze the card for suspicious activity, which It did. The cashier then took me and my cart to the service desk. I explained the problem with my card to the woman there. She told me ""We don't offer tapping here and probably never will."" I thought this was strange, since I use tapping everywhere, and so do most people I know. Then she told me to try swiping again. By this point I was getting frustrated, and of course, swiping again didn't work. I had plenty of money in the account and had used the card to pay for gas just before coming to Walmart, so I knew there was no problem with my account. I tried using a couple of other cards I had, but they didn't work either. I finally just told the customer service woman that I was never going to shop at Walmart again. By this time there were two or three other customer service women standing around the one who was supposed to be helping me. The one who was ""helping"" me said, ""I'm going to go get another cart and started to walk off."" I told her she could keep her Walmart junk and started walking toward the exit. All the women started yelling after me, telling me to get out and go to the King Soopers down the street, and other rude things.I did go to King Soopers after that, but the one near my house. I tried tapping my card there, but it didn't work. I called my bank the next day and they confirmed that the card had been frozen because the muiltiple swiping attempts had triggered their mechanism for suspicious activity, and fixed the problem when I explained what had happened. I ended up paying at King Soopers with another card I had, one of the cards that Walmart had declined. I went online to figure out what had happened at Walmart.  I found this: ""By encouraging customers to use Walmart Pay, Walmart aims to retain control over transaction data and reduce dependency on third-party payment systems. Oct 4, 2024.""So, Walmart chooses greed and trying to exercise customer control over customers' convenience. I also read that Walmart is experiencing problems from underpaying their staff, labor disputes, and having poorly run and understaffed stores, among other things. Since I had not been to a Walmart store in quite a while I was unaware that they did not accept tap payment. If I had been I would not have stopped there. I ended up paying about $10 more at King Soopers than what I would have paid at Walmart for mostly the same items, but the people working at King Soopers are friendly and helpful. The Walmart staff on the other hand were very rude and not helpful at all. They in fact triggered a problem with my card by telling the  to swipe it repeatedly  after I explained the problem with the strip to them. They also declined a different card when I swiped it, although this same card worked fine a short time later at a different store. They could have been more understanding of what was a stressful situation for me instead of being so rude. I had spent over an hour selecting  items and was then unable to pay for them, even though I had several thousand dollars in my account, because they refuse to accept tap pay. OK, they are overworked and underpaid, I understand, but from reading a little on the internet I understand that a lot of people have had problems with this Walmart payment policy, and I'm sure Walmart employees have to deal with a lot of customers who are very unhappy about this. Years ago I worked as a cashier and in customer service at a company similar to Walmart. I trained other employees to work at the service desk as well. I was taught to always be polite and as helpful as possible to customers, whether they were having a problem paying with a card or anything else.  If I had treated a customer the way I was treated at Walmart I would have been in a lot of trouble, and would possibly have been terminated. I WILL NOT be shopping at Walmart again, even after I get my replacement bank card that can be swiped. After this experience I would rather pay a little more somewhere else than pay a single dollar for anything at Walmart!Date of experience:October 20, 2024",1

They delivered it to an address that has not been mine for several years and the only response I get is that they delivered it to the address on the order. I ordered the item with a credit card that requires my current address to even use and yet they defaulted to something else entirely. They are, at best, slow to respond and very patronizing in their customer service. Even though they have contacted the shipping company and confirmed that the item was delivered to the wrong address, they will not move forward until tomorrow after 8 pm for anything.

Walmart, you have not only wasted five hours of my time, but also locked over $700 of my money, leaving me beyond frustrated and mentally drained. Your abysmal service is exactly why this place has such atrociously low ratings—and rightfully so. No one should have to endure what I did just to make a simple purchase.I spent four hours trying to order a product, only to be met with incompetence at every turn. Your customer service gave me a promo code—which didn’t even work. When I reached out for help, I was told to wait seven hours for the code to ""repopulate."" I followed through, waited, and tried again—only for your system to automatically cancel my order!Then, you claimed the issue was with my card’s address, so I fixed it immediately. Instead of resolving the problem, you hit me with another outrageous demand: wait seven more hours. This is absolute madness.This company has no right to operate if it continues treating customers this way. The mental toll this has taken on me is immeasurable, and it’s clear that Walmart prioritizes corporate inefficiency over basic customer care. I am filing a formal complaint with Consumer Protection agencies—people need to be warned about this disgraceful treatment.Shame on you, Walmart. Shame on you for wasting my time, holding my money hostage, and leaving me emotionally drained.

JoAnna Toth,37K reviews,US,2024-10-22T01:49:54.000Z,"Wamart HORRIBLE service and employees!!!I am SO tired of being cheated by these crooks!! I went in to buy an ink cartridge along with several other personal care products, for my HP Deskjet printer/scanner 2132 Walmart sold me years ago for around $50, which only allows me to print 40 copies or less with one ink cartridge, each of which cost $25! The worker in electronics gave me a refurbished cartridge and said it would work on my printer, it was $18. I got home and put it in my printer and then went to print a page, but noticed the light was still flashing so I took the cartridge out and put it back in twice and tried unplugging the printer twice, but it was still doing it, then I took the cartridge out and looked at it and also the one I took out earlier that was empty. The one they gave me was a #61 but the one I had taken out of my printer to replace it was a #63! GRRHH! So, I had to make yet another trip to Walmart across town here in Centralia, IL to exchange it. I talked to three people, the last was Mary Alice, all were painfully rude, had 0 customer service or problem-solving skills and abilities, and like usual acted as if I was bothering them and turned it into a schoolyard drama by hovering together and then each giving me the same response as they looked at each other and acted innocent saying ""We cannot return the cartridge or refund your money, we do not return any cartridges that have been opened"". Then I let them have it, number one their employee is the one who said it was the ""correct cartridge for me to use"", number two I had my receipt showing I had just purchased it there three hours earlier, number three the cartridge is not compatible with my machine and I brought my empty cartridge with me to show them this; which therefore means it could not have been used at all by me and you could see it had not been, I also brought them the original plastic package, box, Walmart bag, etc. I told them that  I just wanted to exchange it for the correct ink cartridge and that I was not throwing out a new cartridge of ink or my $18. They ignored all I said, then tried to blame all on me, saying I should have brought my box from home, and compared them and compared them when I got home before I opened it. They now make $15 hour as much as I did working for the government, but cannot even tell a customer what ink cartridge is the correct one. They are the LAZIEST AND MOST WORTHLESS PEOPLE ON THE PLANET, ALL THEY DO IS STAND THERE BY THE REGISTERS AS WE CHECK AND BAG OUR OWN PRODUCTS AND TRY TO BOSS US AROUND AND ACT  LIKE THEY ARE BULLIES AND GUARDS AND TRY TO MAKE ALL FEEL AS IF THEY ARE THIEVES OR THEY ARE MEAN TO THEM AND KEEP THEM FROM GETTING HELP WITH THEY NEED I!! I HATE POOR PEOPLE LIKE THIS THEY ARE SO EVIL AND MEAN, LAZY, ENTITLED AND WORTHLESS!!  I then got the manager's name and told them I would contact the IL Attorney General and FTC and let the regulators fine them for fraud instead. Their response ""Yeah I guess you will have to"". I then got in my car, contacted their corporate office and blasted them for an hour, then filed a complaint against the store, manager and workers and requested my money back or for them to give me the correct cartridge and NOT throw out the good one I brought back (more waste by these morons), but to use it at the store or return it to the business who fills them to place in a new plastic bag and resell. I have never in my life seen such stupidity and lack of common business sense in my life!! They hire the DUMBEST people on the plant to work in Walmart, including their managers!!!! The corporate office rep said they will be getting back to me within five days and I said, ""NO I WANT THE ISSUE ESCALATED!!!!"" and while you are WORKING ON HELPING ME, I will be filing a complaint with the regulators and reviewing Walmart online, until they find time to fix the problem!! I hope the regulators go after them and fine them millions while I am waiting for them to decide how or if they will refund my $18!!! STUPID owners and STUPID workers!!! They will fight to the death over a penny to commit fraud, but don't even care that it costs them billions of dollars in losses from the regulators or law firms! Everyone I know including myself, HATE WALMART  and the people who work for them and just want them to go bankrupt!! Earlier when I was shopping I was also standing and looking at a product and four times was interrupted from my shopping as one of their fat workers stood there with a push cart with a bunch of bags on it, they were shopping for online orders or putting up orders and continually kept saying, ""Excuse me!"", just to make me move.  They could have easily went down the other fifty aisles next to me that had no one in them, but instead were just trying to annoy me!! MORONS!!

There's no hassles on anything that I've had to return. They allow me to walk into a store set it on the counter They scan a barcode and I'm out the door done and over with.I can get virtually anything I need through Walmart.com with my Walmart plus membership and have it delivered the next day or even two days.I can do all my grocery shopping online and they deliver it to me at no charge.I have had nothing but good experiences with the customer service in the past two years since I've been a member.They go above and beyond the help and try and resolve any issues that you have. The great part is, unlike Amazon, Walmart plus gives you 90 day returns on everything. I think it's outstanding!Like I said before, I know there are a lot of negative reviews on here but I just want to say, I think I've had a great experience with Walmart plus and I will continue to use Walmart and will never step foot on the Amazon website ever again because they have gone downhill so badly.I think everyone should try Walmart Plus and see you how much better things can be. I also really like the fact that Walmart has physical stores where I can go in and return items or pick items up if I do online pickup where I can't do that with Amazon.I'm very pleased with Walmart plus and look forward to continuing my professional relationship with them.Date of experience:October 18, 2024",5

It's truly remarkable a company of its size, scope and resources is unable to create a user-friendly website. It takes some doing to simply place an order. There's often low inventory on our favorites. Simply navigating the website is a challenge. The most recent experience saw issues with two items including-of all things-bananas. The bananas looked great. However, most-once peeled-had an inedible stripe down their centers. It's curious. Walmart boasts being the largest buyer of bananas in the world. One would think it would automatically get the best of them because of buying power.We ordered unsweetened applesauce. It came with 24% sugar, said the label.

You have to press a button for an employee to come, unlock the case and stand there while you pick the product you want. But wait for it ....the expensive makeup isn't locked up. I inquired why they were locking up merchandise and was told due to theft. Now let's think about this, so your telling me thieves only steal cheap make up and leave the expensive stuff, what???? Seems like Walmart is trying to get customers to buy the expensive make up so they don't have to be inconvenienced by trying to get an employee to unlock the merchandise. I wonder did Walmart really think customers would believe their story about theft? So a massive company such as Walmart never thought to simple put tags on the makeup so an alarm would go off if someone tried to steal it? Or hire more professional asset recovery workers? Or get better security? Nope locking up the inexpensive makeup, inconveniencing the customers was apparently the best idea they had and leaving the expensive makeup not locked up.

Instead, once the site recognized my email account and got my CC #, Walmart.com instantly Renewed a former account.  That's not the information I requested, entered nor wanted. Next,  the site refused to allow a refund via cancellation of the 1 year Pre Paid charge for a regular Plus Membership.  I contacted CS a mere 20 min.s later so that I could cancel the unwanted membership and reapply for ""Assist"".  The Rep had no idea what I was takling about, said ""there is no Assist program""  and Memberships are not Refundable.  She continued to parrot whatever I'd said and she repeated back at me.  I gave up and never placed an order. Today, the fool that I am , a DAP solo Senior, I tried again. Yippee, I was able to enter my EBT info. Afterwards, I was instructed to wait for an email confirm.  Instead, what I received from the Walmart Bot was an email requesting that I respond to a long list of very personal questions, including a photo of my Card,which was shocking.  I was required to prove that I had an EBT card. I'd Recertified 6 weeks ago (ReCert required every 3 years for Seniors) in addition to information that was redundant and over the top security questions. Are you kidding me?!?  It made me so uncomfortable I deleted the email and didn't respond. As it is, over the past 10 years I've received 100's of URGENT letters regarding the never-ending account web breach information  ""your information has been exposed to millions of others. Tto protect yourself you must [do this]"".  I'm not sending photos of anything beyond checks to deposit for Mobile Banking via my Bank's Portal. It feels insulting- that Walmart couldn't perform Due Diligence on its own. If there was a concern they could have contacted me. Especially considering that in this day and age anyone can Vet anyone with a few clicks on the keyboard.  I didn't join and won't be placing any orders with Walmart, groceries or otherwise.  I understand why desperate people stay with Amazon regardless of the endless delivery foul ups. I'd just given up my 13 years as a Prime Member.

I have numb fingers and a disability from my military service. I was not able to find the receipt, I forgot that I put it in another part of my wallet, my wallet is full of receipts. I am spending ten minutes to find my receipt and walked to a trash can to find it. People are looking at me, also I was already being stared down, because I am dressed in my religious clothing and being targeted already on top of everything being treated like I am a thief, because my hands were full and I have trouble holding things. They follow me, like I stole what I have purchased. I found the receipt, and the impatience of these people is rude! I showed her the receipt, and I am irritated by now and don't care anymore. She said, she did not see it! I do not care at this point,  I am stressed out and being treated like a thief! What kind of store does this? I do not care about their theft policies, and I do not appreciate to be treated like a thief! I am a Veteran and have served honorably then I come back and get treated like this! I really flipped because of the disrespectful treatment! I have been shopping at Walmart for 28 years and today was my last day ever to go there or any other Walmart! I will no longer support a business, that treats me like I am less of a person and treated like a thief for something I had bought from their store. I stopped frequenting Walmart because of this, but today was too much after all of these years! Walmart's customer service is so inferior-this is a free country and you treat your customers like they are thieves! If you cannot handle your employees, of course people will steal! You don't have enough people to work there, yet you want the merchandise to be checked when a customer leaves like it is a military checkpoint!

My mother received her order and mine did not arrive in the time that I requested (between 2 & 4pm). I called 2 or 3x yesterday and it wasn’t until the last call that I was told the driver cancelled my order. It is now 11:50 am the next day and I still have no groceries. I called again today and asked for a suptervtisor and that was a horrible experience. The supervisors name is Edsln (incident number 241005-52701-0200-0000). The agents I spoke with prior to him kept telling me all they could do was send a request to Walmart to attach a driver. Once that was done I should get my groceries by 8:00pm today.My daughter and I haven’t eaten since yesterday morning and because they have my order AND they have my money I CANT buy anymore food, Then, after all that Edsln offered me a $25 gift card towards a future order, as if that was the going rate for me to accept the apologies. That supervisor was heartless, inconsiderate, and had no compassion for the inconvenience this whole ordeal has caused. My mother and I have  been Walmart+ members for a little while now and I have NEVER been treated this way. My daughter is only 16, She can’t fend for herself.

After receiving a notification that the item I wanted was “back in stock,” I placed two separate orders (ending in 239 and 141). Not only was one of these orders delayed for several days without any real explanation, but now I’ve been notified that one of them has been canceled entirely!The vague “delayed, check back for updates” message in the app for days on end is just poor customer service. For a company the size of Walmart, you’d think they could handle something as simple as a Hot Wheels order. What’s even more frustrating is that the same items are still being sold on their website, fulfilled by one of their affiliates. Why wasn’t that option considered sooner if they couldn’t fulfill the order themselves?To make matters worse, one order is canceled and the other is still delayed with no end in sight. How does a multi-billion-dollar company drop the ball this badly on such a simple order?

The young woman cashing me out stated that I was unable to purchase all 4 gift cards because of 'scams' that have been occurring. Mind you, this was after all 4 cards had already been rang up. 2 Visa Gift Cards were voided and I paid for the other two. After further inspection, both gift cards that I had been given were the voided ones, and the other two I had paid for were kept by the employee.Fast forward to today, I attempted to go to Customer Service to get help and resolve being given two gift cards that were not activated. The ""acting"" store manager Kristen, approximately 5'9 with long brown hair, supposedly reviewed the footage and refused to help me. She would not even look at the receipt that I was providing which clearly showed the two cards I had in hand were void by her employee. Not only was I met with eye-rolling, and blatant disrespect. I was told that I had to immediately leave the store.So beware! This store advocates for theft by their employees and allows incompetent managers to disrespect customers.

I needed a pre-paid sim for my phone as I’m from the UK just visiting friends for a couple of weeks. I went to Walmart in Carroll and asked the advice of the person on the electronics counter. I took his advice and purchased a StraightTalk pre-paid sim. I left the store and attempted to activate the sim with no luck. I returned the next day and Ed was on the electronics counter. Ed was great, he tried everything and ended up calling the provider in order to get it working. I left once again after the sim provider said it would be active in about 30 minutes. Well it still didn’t work so I went back again and once again Ed did everything possible but with no luck. I asked for a refund so he called the manager who said ‘sorry but no refunds on sim’s’. So I bought the one they recommended, I spent a lot of time back and forth, the sim wouldn’t work in my unlocked Moto 13 that is 7 months old and still they wouldn’t give a refund. Rubbish customer service Walmart. It might be the phones fault but when you do what you are advised and pay $50+ you would think as big as Walmart is it could give you a refund.

The coffee maker cost 100 dollars. After several stores I arrive at the supercenter at 2700 Kirkwood at 08:30 am the customer service person tells me that she can not take the machine, I show her the number provided by the company and also deltante of her I make the call. The lady in a very bad way does not want to listen to what the brand warranty says, then she gives me a walmart customer service phone number so I can complain there and they will attend me, I call the walmart customer service number and they tell me to ask to speak with the manager, but the employee at the counter tells me that she can not attend me. After 20 minutes with the walmart customer service man on the phone, the manager appears and continues to insist that she can't do anything for me and in a bad way she also answers to the person on the phone. I keep waiting and tell her that in addition to the ticket I have the warranty book that says it is for two years and that any problem I should call and ask for the confirmation number and present it to walmart customer service so that they accept the machine.After serving me, making me wait for over an hour and treating me badly; he finds the coffee maker loaded with another code (the one from the cash register) and since it was out of stock he suggests giving me a store credit card. I don't know why they refund me $52.50 instead of $100. When I go back to the usual store they tell me they can't do anything so I go back to the Kirkwood store. After several times with no response I am told that the person who authorized the return is on vacation. By this time I had been to the store more than 7 times and a month and a half had passed. I go again recently and the person is still not there but I ask to speak to the Manager and very kindly a lady who is the Store Manager (not customer service) attends me and tells me that she can't do anything for me, that she regrets my experience but to call again.

The online pot arrived damaged. I was told in the live chat by two different people that they contacted the seller for a replacement. One of them said to call in a week for a tracking number since i had no email confirmation, which seemed odd. So i called a week later. They then confirmed my suspicions that they never actually contacted the seller. They said i would have gotten an email. So I was lied to twice by walmart chat. Ive been waiting 2 weeks for this to get resolved. Long wait. All they did was keep offering promo codes and tell me i had to go through the seller and that none of this was on walmart since it is through a third party seller. But It is literally through walmarts site! They said i had to return the item but i did not want to as compensation for all this, plus why are they having their customers do all the work to go return items or talk to the sellers when the customer is not at fault?

After entering all required info.I was approved for the purchase through Affirm.  I started the order process. It was stated the mini fridge would deliver on 8/29/24. I received a delivery notice on 8/29/24, addressed to someone else name and address. I notified Walmart customer service that the delivery notice has a different name and address, additionally I filed a dispute with Affirm. I contacted Walmart again on Sept 3,2024, I was denied any resolution. They told me I was responsible, I never included the name on the order, never heard of the person and not the delivery address on the receipt emailed to me. How this person name and address pop up on my account I have no idea. Perhaps that person had my phone number in the past and that AI crap inserted that info on my account. However, Affirm says I am responsible for payment based on Walmart's claim, something their system screwed up.

When placing the order the item showed as available same day as the other items. After making payment, and picking up the order I noticed when I got home that one item was not included.

Even though it is sitting in a Walmart store, with Walmart employees,  they refuse to cancel, refund or send back. I have to either drive 7 hours to the store or wait the 21 days for them to ship back and the time to process a refund from there. A month before I can be refunded!Do not order from this company online. They have procedures that make no sense. I have no idea how they make so much money when logistically, their practices are totally whacked.

I then contacted Walmart Canada about this issue and they said because it outside the timeline of 90 days (not written anywhere) that I had to contact the manufacturer. I told them the issue and they said it was not their problem but the manufacturer issue. I finally got in contact with someone from Onn and went threw the claim procedures. Since then I have gotten email after email from them saying ""we're almost there"" but keep claiming that there was first an issue with being able to see the model and serial number from the picture of the back of the TV I provided from their request (I of course had no issue getting that info from the photo whatsoever). Then they emailed and said that there was an issue with the receipt (which I provided them with the full receipt I received from the online purchase). Now they said there is an issue with confirming my mailing address as they could not find it on Google maps. Really? Couldn't find my street address on Google maps? On a house that has been here longer than Google has been around in one of the oldest cities in Canada?

Now it's 42 check out lanes with 1 person or even 0 persons when you show up.  There are mislabled prices on shelves and a very very long line at customer service.  So recently I decided to start ordering online.  Also my vehicle had a breakdown.  But it's every order that i place something in my cart that is ""unavailble"" when it comes time to deliver my food.  Also when you order items from the store that say ""delivery tomorrow"" that is untrue.  They suddenly say ""unavailble"" and ""availble for shipping.""  And this is last minute.  I recently ordered a mini fridge and an ice maker because my big fridge is going out, it's barely keeping my food cold.  I even paid more for it because I thought I could get it today.  But it might show up tommorow now.  I called customer service to get a delivery fee returned, because I paid 9.95 only to have a few shelf stable dinners deliverd, because other items are being shpped.  The representative was rude and wanted to shove me along.  He did give me a promo code for 10.00 off my next order.

They also have very unreliable third-party delivery service. I am a grad student and it is imperative that I get my books on time for my classes. I went ahead and ordered my books well before school started from Walmart. When the delivery service couldn't find my apartment, they sent the item back to the sender rather than just contacting me... I called customer service four different times throughout my busy week to try and have these item sent back to me. Each time costomer service assured me I would have my items back and I never did. I called them back one last time and they said that I would need to refund the items and order them again. Well, I needed to have read two chapters from one of these books already for one of my classes so I decided to take my business elsewhere, like Amazon. I wanted some sort of compensasion for wasting so much of my time and they offered me a $25 promo code that I could only use for certain items and for orders above $45. Not to mention those orders had to be made online and wouldn't apply in store. Absolutely ridiculous. They might as well not have given me any compensasion at all. As a student, I put my trust in Walmart to be able to deliver these items that are important for my academic success and I clearly made a mistake. I will not be visiting Walmart anytime soon.

Gene,16reviews,US,2024-08-25T22:47:56.000Z,"Lying Lazy Walmart Automotive Employees Lawrenceville Suwanee StoreI order expensive Pirelli 20 inch radials for my Ford SUV from Walmart 3245 LAWRENCEVILLE SUWANEE RD, Suwanee, GA 30024.I knew Walmart employees around Atlanta were lazy but figured they were good for a quick oil change or tires. Not any more.I always pay extra for the lifetime rotation and balance but every time I go in to have a rotation and balance I get the distinct impression they're looking for any reason to keep from doing the work. ""the tire is damaged, the tire is too worn to rotate and balance."" This set of tires has 36,000 miles and the tires are rated for 65,000. Walmart refuses to rotate and balance based on the tread wear.  I'm 66 years old, I've had as many as 500 worksite employees and I know when an employee is lying and conning me. They were all acting odd because they knew they were lying to me. This is the 4th or 5th time I've dealt with lazy, lying Automotive employees turning a good, valid customer away on technicalities. I said fine, I'll special order 2 more Pirellis, but I'm going to Florida and I need these tires rotated and balanced before the trip.Finally the big black female manager in her angry talk to her child voice explained they can't do the rotation and balance because of tread wear. Regardless of whether I order another 2 tires for $500. I said these tires have another 20,000 miles at least and I'm not ready to buy more right now. She said no. I said fine. No more tire purchases at Walmart.I already have an inquiry in and an appointment with can-do, get-it-done employees at Discount Tire on Duluth Hwy next to the Sugarloaf Mall in Lawrenceville. Oh, and by the way, they gladly meet or beat Walmart prices so it's no skin off my wallet. Good bye Walmart Automotive.By the way, this was race thing in my opinion.  If you're white, middle class you're not welcome here. You'll get a big black mamma in your face enjoying telling you you're not getting anything from them.Walmart Automotive Departments in the outlying areas with good-ole country boys are 100% better.

Stafford Hunter,1review,US,2024-08-24T16:28:55.000Z,"I had the worst experience at Walmart…I had the worst experience at Walmart auto care at 7800 SMITH RD, Denver CO 80207A few months ago, I had an oil change there. Upon returning for my next oil change they tell me that the oil drain bolt was damaged by whoever did the last oil change. I remind them that they did my oil changes. After they figure out who did it (who was previously fired for bad work), they tell me to buy the bolt somewhere then they’d reimburse me and install it. But they offered no proof of this conversation. Of course I ask but they say that they go on memory. They don’t write on my computer account or put such things on paper. Just trust them. I argue for 30mins with serviceman Austin and manager Paul (I think) of the possible problems but they insist. Said that he (Austin) also managers Paul and Richard would remember. Months later I return and of course no one remembers. We discuss for 20mins, then they agree to it. They take my car, and they say they’ll text me when done. I walk away for almost 2 hours, and come back to no one knowing where my car is. Then, having no record of it being checked in even thought they texted me to say the work has started. Then, after 2 hours of waiting I come back. They say they didn’t change the oil because they couldn’t take off the bolt. But for 2 hours they never contacted me to tell me. Then, they ask me to go to another mechanic to have the bolt remove, and say they’ll reimburse me. They then take 40mins to get approval. I ask again for something in writing. They say no. I say at least tell what needs to be done, and I can record it with my phone to tell the next mechanic. Service person Austin says that he doesn’t want his voice recorded. 🤷🏾. After 15-20mins of arguing he agrees to write something instructions down on paper. After several shops say they can’t remove bolt without doing an oil change I find one shop who said they’d add some oil so I can drive it back to Walmart or take the bolt half off. I make an appt. Then as I am in their shop, I call Walmart. They say that they can’t do it that day. So, I had to make another appt at the other shop that is going to remove the bolt. After the 3rd day of this, I get the bolt loosened (not to lose the oil), so I can make it back to Walmart with oil. Then back to Walmart for more memory loss conversation. But then Austin asked for a higher manager (sorry, I forgot her name) to step in. After explaining the whole thing to her, she said that she’d reimburse me. I then got the oil change and my money. But this was a complete headache and waste of 3 days of my time. My time waiting while no work was done, my time searching and going to several repair shops to find someone to do the work. My time making appointments with Walmart. My time arguing with them when they simply refuse to document their words. This was the worst experience thanks to the inexcusable efforts of Austin, and managers Paul and Richard. Also, service person Lisa was quite rude to me while trying to step into conversations that she knew little details about to make excuses for Walmart. I’m surely done with Walmart Auto Care.

They are atrocious! I bought a lawn mower online and it failed to work properly so I went online to start a return. Since I didnt have the box for it, I had the option of returning it to the store without  it. I chose the Glendale Ave  store. Went in with the lawn mower, gave the girl the print out of the barcode she needed to process it and before she even scanned it she told me she couldnt take it because it didnt have a box (excuse #1). I said to her that Walmart online said I could bring it here and you would take care of boxing it, she said she got in trouble for taking a return without the box, so she would call her team leader, I said okay. Her team leader showed up, Devon I believe, and said the same thing about not having a box, so I told him again, what the Walmart Online said. So he called Michelle, his team coach (I think) who told him, they could take it if it didnt have gas in it. I told him the gas was run out of it. He removed the gas cap and told her he could smell gas. I said of course you do, its a GAS tank, duh. He walked off on his walkie talkie and came right back saying that Michelle said bring it back when you get the gas out of it (excuse #2), then another guy walks up, takes the gas cap off and says, you need to take it home and clean that out and bring it back. (unsolicited excuse from the peanut gallery) by this time all I wanted to do was talk to Michelle, so that's what I said to them. Get Michelle up here please. They kept talking about how and why they won't take it and I just kept asking for Michelle, or Michelle's information so I can tell headquarters who she is. Michelle told them that she was busy and wasn't coming. I got on the phone after that and called the headquarters about everything that just took place and was out in the parking lot on the phone with them. After about 20-25 minutes Michelle shows up. I had headquarters on the phone still and went to talk to her, she said she came out and looked at the mower and would have taken it back but, security wont let you back in the store...wait...What!? I went through the whole scenerio with her about all the bad excuses I was given only to be told that you were too busy to address the situation yourself and now to find out that I am not allowed in the store because of YOUR employees bad service, it was astounding. I couldnt believe what I just went through with them. The woman on the phone was soooo apologetic and she knew exactly what had went down and heard Michelle basically admit to it all. I rarely ever go to that store to begin with I will never go there again...I'll go to another city first.

The problem started about a year ago. I normally order bottled water and various groceries. I started to notice that they would tell me they were all out of bottled water. Also if I ordered cold items like ice cream or milk it would be luke warm. I was not sure if it was the preparer leaving the food out till delivery or the delivery driver. I noticed they never use cold bags. Over load bags and frequently put cleaning products in with perishables. On several occasions I recieved ice cream that was liquid. When I contacted customer service they told me to return the melted items to the store. This occurred in the Hamilton. NJ store. It is very frustrating because putting the cold items in an insulated bag would solve the issue. Telling me I have to drive to the store to return items when I paid for a plus membership ship is disgraceful. And today when I did not recieve the water I ordered when I know it was in stock is frustrating. Then I tried to place an order and they told me I had return violations so they canceled my order. I had to throw out the bad food over the last few months and I returned nothing and they still blocked my account. I was able to call and after several hours they fixed the issue with no apology.

Even if I order other things from another department to be delivered with the antibiotic they still will not bring the antibiotic. Jesus, I could understand if it was an opiate. Now before I even paid for the upgraded service I asked a pharmacy tech when I was in there if they delivered from the pharmacy and she said yes, everything except the liquid testosterone I am prescribed. Pharmacy delivery is the main reason I paid the money for the service although I buy a few hundred in groceries a month there and planned on ordering online occasionally if I didn't like driving the 2 miles if it was raining. Also that streaming service is basic and you will need to upgrade that if hate commercials. I don't remember them mentioning that in the promo ad I received. I still have not been able to use that because I am not tech savy. When I was in the store a couple of months ago I asked a women in customer service if she could help me on it or give me a number. She was the only person working and the were 6 or 7 people behind me. She said I don't know anything about that then said, ""next."" I should have said can you at least give me a contact number of someone who can help but I didn't. Anyone considering getting this hundred a month service would be advised to get Amazon for 20 or 30 bucks more. I should have my head examined for waisting my money on Walmart delivery. I have Amazon and will stick with them. I don't know if they sell pharmaceuticals but I will look into it.Date of experience:August 14, 2024",1

I went to the store clerks, and they did not speak English and without care (which is not professional). Their policy needs to improve as well as need to hire at least 2 people for the vast store that speak English fluently plus care.  The products are excellent and reasonably priced, but they will not be sustained if people steal at that rate. Stealing is a huge problem---the people stealing have no respect for themselves or others, and the lack of accountability is shocking because no one speaks English or else does not care.Date of experience:August 09, 2024",2

I had a series of issues as a Walmart+ member with my grocery deliveries. I kept calling and complaining about dairy and cold items being left outside in the hot sun, not bringing things to my door as requested due to me being a disabled Veteran.I sent their top 16 leaders confirmed email addresses the police report, Better Business Bureau report, FTC report, my own bank records and receipts from their own website showing how they did this!!!Yet, 5 days after the fact, they continue to ignore my emails, calls for someone from Corporate or their own ethics team. Little do they realize it, but it will be on the national news tomorrow in the NY area. I did a Zoom interview because they had hundreds of similar complaints about the same thing.I had to remove my payment methods off their website, stop my monthly subscription, to their so called Walmart+ membership and file all these reports of proven fraud. I want to delete my online account, but then I lose access showing them the fraud on the receipts.They not only charged me a $99.99 TIP amount from a horrible delivery which they left food outside plus I called and complained before ending my membership. Why would I ever give any or this much tip for horrible service???Then, on top of that they also made 4 attempts within 20 seconds of one another proven from my 2 banks, total on my 1 card on their website for over $1100, then 3 more to my other card which were all declined as I had pre-set limits as I have been an identity theft victim for years.Why doesn't Walmart Leadership want to protect its own customers (now former) plus they are loosing money from all of the customers ruining their name, reputation, and terrible reviews.I look forward to see how this plays out.

On 07/03/24 at 11:59AM, I purchased a $100 Walmart Gift Card from Walmart #3612, 530 S. Graham Hopedale Rd., Burlington, NC 27215. The security strip was fully intact and had not been scratched. I presented the gift card to the recipients on 08/01/24 as a housewarming gift. On 08/02/24, the security strip was scratched by the recipient who verified the balance online. Walmart’s online system reflected a $0 balance on the gift card. The phone number on the back of the card was called and again, the phone system verified a $0 balance. The Walmart agent stated the card was redeemed online from someone in New Hampshire on 07/16/24 to purchase an Apple iPad. Neither I nor the recipient redeemed the gift card and this was a clear case of fraud.I made an online police report with the Burlington, NC police department at 11:06 AM, 08/05/24 to report the fraud. The police department rejected the report on 08/06/24 with the following statement: We're sorry the following problem was found during review of your submitted report T24000209:Due to the circumstances of the incident, this crime occurred outside of Burlington Police Department's jurisdiction. If you could, please reach out to your local police department for further assistance.I submitted an online complaint to Walmart Customer Care on 8/07/24 about this incident and was instructed to contact Walmart.com for resolution, which I previously contacted on 08/02/24 with no resolution.On 08/07/24 at approximately 12:43PM, I returned to the Walmart location where the gift card was purchased to report the incident. I spoke to Manager Virginia who stated that “you’re not the only one this has happened to. You have to contact the number on the card. We can’t help you.” I was then accused by another cashier that I “redeemed it on 07/15/24 online. You held onto this for 2 weeks and now you’re in here claiming that someone else did this!” I assured her that I did not redeem it and the security code was intact when I presented it to the recipient.As a remedy, I am requesting a $100 refund from Walmart.

I went to Walmart 3 days later and purchased over $430 worth of groceries. I went to pay with my credit card, to receive my rewards dollars and the card wouldn't work. We tried 4 times, and I asked the cashier if he has to activate it on his end because I already called. He said oh they have been changing the rewards and percentages so maybe you need to check that. I said I'm not interested in those extras and I already called and got it activated and denied those questions when offered over the phone. So I had to use my debit to complete the transaction and lose out on all those rewards I could have gained on my account. I just called Walmart activation number and only got automated messages as its stating my card is already activated. So I called the customer service line to speak with a rep, and when I explained the situation that occurred she said it could be the machine and I said well I'm calling to let you know that my card didn't work, and I lost out on my points. She said well on my end its activated and it could be the machine. I said but my other card worked, so the machine worked fine. She wasn't understanding that I was calling to let her know there is an issue with my card and I didn't get to receive my rewards because I wasn't able to use that card and if she could apply them to my account since I told her the amount I spent and how many would be collected. She said she couldn't add any rewards to my account because I didn't use my card. Well I couldn't when you rejected it every time I tried. The cashier even told me to call and ask for my rewards. And then I was told no, and that it was the machine. I said you're really not going to rectify this issue, this is your problem not mine. I'm not the reason the card or machine didn't work? She had no sympathy for anything, and I even mentioned how before I've had multiple issues with their cards, and them cancelling orders of mine and flagging things before communicating with me.

My delivery date was 8/2/2024. I was home when the delivery driver arrived with only 1 of my items which was the lamp. When the driver arrived he pulled into my driveway. He searched his vehicle for my packages for about 3 minutes as I watched. The driver pulled 1 package out of his car and walked to my door. Once there he sat the package on the porch. I picked the package up and was immediatly asked to put it back down so that he could take a picture of it. Once the driver took the picture I asked if there were anymore items? He said this was the only package. Once the drive left I received an email stating my order was delivered. The only item I received and the only item the driver took a picture of was the lamp. The bike was never delivered. I've spoken with several reps including a supervisor (Muhamed) who stated they only see a picture with the 1 item which is clearly too small to be a bike. My refund and/or replacement has been denied twice and I'm extremely upset. Either Walmart is stealing or the people they put in charge of deliver our packages are stealing. What's even worse is the supervisor gave up info on the driver but won't give contact info for Walmart Corp. Please replace my item or refund my money. I've been a customer too long to let Walmart or their drivers rob me for ANY amount of money. If I took from them I would be fully prosecuted.

SoldierGirl Nails,1review,US,2024-08-02T16:54:17.000Z,"I'm starting to not like Walmart online and pickupI go to Walmart because I can usually get all I need in one spot.  I went to purchase a TV in the store because it was in my price range.  Well, if you don't read the fine print, the price that was in my price range was for online orders only!!!  When I get to the store there was a lot of people shopping.  In the electronics dept there was only one person working there.  I wanted fabric cut at around 5:30pm and was told the 'person' that cuts fabric had left for the day.  I will no longer order for pickup.  Apparently, I have to choose my store more than once in my online account.  I would have thought that would be a one and done. I ordered an item only to realize when I went to my store to pick it up that it was at another store.  It was not easy getting the refund back.  I cancelled the item the same day and went to my local store to get the item.  Well, Walmart did not process the refund until the day they said was the last day I could pick it up before 'they' cancelled.  Why couldn't they cancel the same day I cancelled?  Also, multiple times people have tried to load the wrong order into someone else's vehicle.  I was told that Walmart has cut staff and hours and are now making less people work in multiple areas and expecting them to complete all tasks.  That is abuse in my opinion.  The store was really crowded, but only 2 cashiers with all the self checkout machines.  I use self-checkout mostly, but not all people want to do that.  School is opening back up, so that is probably the reason for all the people there.  There should have been more cashiers.  I get the feeling that it won't be long before I no longer shop at Walmart online or in-store. They also charge a 6.99 fee if you don't order $35 or more for PICKUP!  I'm not asking for them to ship it, it's a pickup.  They also take out 'hold funds'.  Does not make sense at all?  If my order is $30 and they hold $40, how is that ensuring I have enough money for the order?  If I have $36 in my account and I order only $30, I'm already covered.  Adding the hold fee could cause someone to go into overdraft.  It should be illegal to process a hold fee.Date of experience:August 01, 2024",2

I talked to ""Arup Gupta"" (hard to find a phone number) and got nowhere. Apparently if you don't order in a while they cancel orders without any attempt to fix the problem.

in my pocket so I did for about 7 hours straight l left the pan handle on Gainesville,fl with about 300$ so I go grab me something to eat from Bolay where I use to work at I’m going to leave them an honest review to trust me they probably had something to do with this so as I leave Bolay boom I said well I have my kitten and she might need some fresh food so we goes to Walmart right cross the street as I’m walking through the parking lot a black lady walk by with some orange and blue on and said “you don’t know how much power I got’ and kept walking I looked both ways as I crossed the street trying to find who she was talking to turns out nobody was their so it had to be me I ignored her and proceeded into Walmart then it just started raining so I rushed into Walmart as I go into Walmart I was being followed from the pan handle I started noticing ppl talking about me and ppl following me I go to the fisher ale to restock on mace but when I got there it was like 9 people in football pads holding machetes not saying nothing just examining so I walk straight threw the middle of them nervous cause of what ppl are saying about me so my anxiety is kicking in at that point cause I didn’t know why football players was holding machetes while everyone was walking through Walmart talking mess about me so I left that ale to get away from them go to the electronics ale where I’m more comfortable at then next thing you know someone throws an Seminoles foot ball at me witch is assault and with all this going on at this point my anxiety is about to flip out cause ppl are throwing things at me and me as a homeless ain’t bout to let people get use to that matter fact someone drove down the high way and throw and egg at me as I was sleep on the side walk I called the police and told him I wanted to sue them for their car he ain’t even take the police report and it was at least 12 cameras pointing at that spot I was sleeping in cuss that’s the reason why I was sleeping their but let’s keep going with the Walmart story so I admit to saying a few word in my defense after seeing what I just saw on the last ale and herring what I just heard and knowing I’m being followed stalked and Harassed by the public but ay nobody cares about a homeless man’s rights so a try to keep my calm grab my bearings and walk away for the people who don’t like me so I go all the way to the food ale why every time I get to this one dudes ale that works their he’s bashing a wooden pallet on the ground making it sound like gun shots I’m looking at this boy like why are you doing that your scaring people and he only does it when I walk by so then I notice every one doing a full Evacuation like it’s a bomb threat going on in Walmart so I move with traffic and said it’s to much going on in Walmart time for me to go as I reach the exit and this how I know this was set up some home their was a boy with Down syndrome like his face was falling off the side of his head or something flick me off like jump right in from of me started walking with his momma turn around and shot a bird at me as we both was leaving the exit doors I turned right and out of over 900 ppl in the parking lot they had all female officers pull up and gunned an Innocent men down like he was a criminal knowing I’m a Law abiding citizen that get treated like a class A Killah and I still want to know how they knew to point the guns at me what did they manager call and tell yall cause ain’t nobody see the football team who was all holding machetes throwing a football at me run out the side door and not the front talking bout the one in the auto zone shop that was closed that day ain’t nobody see them but everybody notice the homeless men who doesn’t bother anybody and who lost his whole studio and what’s crazy bout that is they gave me 3 years probation I get off next year at the beginning but what I don’t understand is why am I being tressed passed from being armed when my life was being threatened from the time I step on Walmart property like the camera will show everything if you think I’m lying air the footage of me leaving the pane handle  all I do that day was wake up brush

They are flash frozen & are healthier than “fresh” ones. The liquor store is the most unreliable, but if go into the store you know why.

Then scheduled the appointment. 1 hour prior to appointment, the service was canceled due to 1 tire not arriving at the auto care center. I rescheduled hoping the tire would soon be delivered. The service was canceled again. After 17 days, the tire hadn’t been delivered. I call the 800 number, the guy says that it was delivered and to call the store. The store says they only have 3 tires. I call the 800 number back and he offers me a $10 gift card and says they will expedite the tire delivery and it will be at the store in 3 days. Needless to say the tire was supposed to be delivered yesterday. I go to the store early this morning and inquire about the tire. The lady says there are only 3 tires (she is physically standing in the room, looking at the tires). I call the 800 number, first guy says the tire was delivered, I let him talk to the lady, she tells him she only has 3 tires… he says he is going to call Fed-Ex. Of course, the call gets disconnected. I call the 800 number back… another guy tried to pull the thing about it being delivered… then stated they tried to deliver it… then bluntly said the tire was lost and my services had somehow been cancelled. (Wow! Not my problem. I just want 4 of the same tires to put on my car.) He too speaks with the lady in the store and they have a conversation, no fix obviously. He said I could wait 10 days for the delivery, reorder the tire, or get a refund. I asked to speak to a supervisor. She had more sense but couldn’t fix the problem. I would have to cancel that tire to order another. Why? I ordered 4 tires, I didn’t assign myself to those 4 tires (the brand yes but not the tires)… get another tire and send it to the store. She asked if I would use another tire… not one with different tread pattern that’s why I ordered 4. I’m told I would have to be refunded the money for the tire. I asked for a refund on all 4 tires instead because it’s ridiculous. 21 to 22 days later I still don’t have the complete set of tires, you want me to do the leg work, and your customer service sucks. Instead of refunding the money, they cancelled the entire order which apparently takes 6 to 10 days to get my money back for the 4 tires and services I paid for. I am very disappointed. Soon I may just have to completely stop dealing with Walmart.Date of experience:July 20, 2024",1

So, now I am being refunded and see that Wal-mart is selling the same model but at full price.

Sad, really.I ordered from Walmart and my card was charged by Walmart for a desk.  The desk was to be shipped to Los Angeles County, California.  Sales Order Id:  200012139394524.  But, there was no desk.  Rather, Canddidlike supplied Fed Ex with the above Order number to be used to ship a “bar” to an address in BERKELEY, California.When the bar was delivered, Fed Ex notified Walmart that Order Id:  200012139394524 had been delivered.  As far as Walmart knew, and relying on the Order number, the “desk” had been delivered to the correct address in Los Angeles County, California.Walmart, unaware of the facts, notified us that the “desk” had been delivered.  Vigorous protest ensued, including directing Walmart to the Fed Ex record of delivery showing it had delived a “bar” to an address in Berkeley CA.  Rather than waiting on “Canddidlike” Walmart initiated a refund on its own.  Canddidlike then e-mailed us insisting that in order to get a refund, we should lie to Walmart and claimed we had actually received the desk but had afterwards lost it.  If we may quote our good friend, Vizzini: ""Inconceivable!"" (The Princess Bride. 1987).  But true.While we knew immediately that by stating we had received the desk but then “lost” it, there would be no refund and Canddidlike would be able to keep the money, our concern was that others, the elderly, the inexperienced, the gullible would fall victim to this scam.  So, we notified Walmart.  You expect Walmart to be concerned one of its vendors was attempting to get a customer to lie?  Get use to disappointment.  Walmart did nothing.

This is my biggest gripe with trust pilot. Your bad experience doesn’t invalidate an entire company.Walmart provides reasonably priced goods to many cities across the U.S. People rely on them for clothes, groceries, and other household goods. I consistently rely on them for fresh produce and other groceries. They’re never out.Rating 4 stars due to them underpaying their employees and squandering local businesses.

Then I was told I have to take the tire myself to customer service counter for a refund, I get to customer service, there's a long line, so I took the steps online for the refund, which told me to return the tire at the Auto center service counter.

I went home with some things that I needed and I got on my computer instead of the cell phone and went to the Walmart website and chose one store that's on the other end of town and they seem like they'll have it in stock but I can't rely on Walmart's website to give you any kind of accuracy. Checking the local store I see the three that were not available on my personal visit after wasting 15 minutes to get an associate to unlock the glass case, would be available for pickup tomorrow but I was told that they wouldn't have them for a week.

I was looking to buy some dental floss, Reach mint dental floss. Unfortunately they were out of it. So I decided to purchase the equate mint dental floss brand. As we all know Walmart's motto is save money live better. I can tell you that if you purchase equate dental floss, you'll find that it is the cheapest worst dental floss you can ever use. It falls apart when using leaving tiny threads in your teeth and then you have to go back and dental floss again just to remove the threads from the previous use. So you use much more of it. My advice is do not ever ever purchase equate dental floss, it's better just to buy something that cost a little more and is much more effective.Date of experience:May 17, 2024",1

That seemed to go better if the promises made today are kept.  I have changed the rating from a 1 to a 3 today due to that phone call and will raise it higher if the promises are kept.Basically, what happened was at the store I usually shop at I was treated so poorly as I tried to get a riding cart and handicapped assistance that I left in tears both from physical pain the poor service greatly exacerbated plus from the emotions I was feeling from how badly I’d been treated.Since that experience made me feel unsafe shopping in-store any more, I went home and applied for Walmart+ on the 50% discount program that people on social security are eligible for through SheerID approval.  I was denied because the paperwork I submitted was from the Social Security Administration and SheerID said the Social Security Administration and Social Security Insurance payments were two separate entities so they couldn’t approve it, stating that was Walmart’s guidelines.  After two weeks of trying to help them understand that the Social Security Administration administers Social Security Insurance payments, I gave up.  That whole two-week story can be read on the Trustpilot review I left for SheerID.At that time, I only saw the option to chat on Walmart’s website, so I chatted with them several times on both the issue of my treatment in the store and the SheerID problem, and it didn’t go well at all.  Honestly, it was handled so badly that I made a decision not to shop at Walmart any more and haven’t shopped there since.  It was the principle of it all, because at that point I felt like Walmart was saying they support the handicapped and elderly in stores and have a 50% discount on Walmart+ for them to look socially conscious without delivering.I’m going to be honest that I needed something today that I could get much less expensively at Walmart, so I looked online and found a phone number that isn’t on their website, I called and talked with a person who does Walmart store support as well as being transferred to someone who works in Walmart+ and it went much better.  They were both very nice and made promises that will lead to reasonable resolutions if they’re able to keep those promises. So, for now i’m raising their rating to a 3 and will raise it higher if there able to keep those promises.Date of experience:June 08, 2024",3

Derrick,1review,US,2024-06-18T22:33:38.000Z,"Accused of stealing my own property PUBLICLY, detained, and physically touched.On Monday 06/10/2024 AT 8:05pm CST, I was to meet two prospective clients at the Walmart at 2727 Dunvale Rd #2066. I’d brought with me a sample monitor carried in a Walmart cart due to size and entered the Home & Improvement entrance of the store. I was greeted by a male employee who asked did I have a return to be stickered. I informed him it was my item I’d brought in, and he simply nodded and told me have a good night. I then got a text from my clients, informing me they were at the grocery entrance, so I made an immediate right and proceeded down the front walkway, never crossing the metal turnstiles into the merchandised area of the location. Your receipt checker demanded a receipt for an item I informed her I brought in, and could be verified by a simple radio check. I was then racially and physically accosted by your two workers “Joe” and “Farah”.I was then detained while repeatedly grilled about why i brought my item in, in an extremely accusatory and hostile manner. “Joe” proceeds to then try to justify the almost 10–15-minute encounter by stating “This doesn’t make sense why you would bring this in, you know what you all do.” I am an African American man, so it is abundantly clear what he meant by this statement. After scanning, alleged Asst Manager Farah backs away & She then attempts a half-hearted apology by stating “It’s okay brother. You’re good, but you know what they do around here.” Alleged Asst Manager Farah then decided to reach over and pat my shoulder repeating “It’s okay brother. You’re good, but you know what they do around here. The receipt checker was just doing her job. You must know what they all do around here.” At this stage I was utterly mentally and physically exhausted from this exchange and the embarrassment of being accused of stealing my own property and spoken to in a prejudicial manner as if I was an aloof child. I requested “Joe’s” name and that was all the info he provided, and refused to provide an incident number, badge information, or any details regarding himself while claiming to be the store manager. He had not identifiable Walmart branded clothing or badge on his person. He was wearing a black polo, with light brown/gold animal logo. “Farah” who claimed to be the Asst Mgr and claimed “Joe” was the store manager. Both refused to provide anything further or offer a true apology recognizing their failure to easily deescalate and verify. Also being told suggestively that being an African American minority with an item I bring in instantly qualifies me for unfound accusations, searches, and seizures. As for being touched unwarranted, this is a clear violation of law, and your corporations guidelines and ethics. Store Manager of Walmart #2066 Michael Longoria, and Walmart Inc despite receiving certified letters detailing to complaint and detailed physical assault have yet to respond to the defamation of my character, being subject to racially charged accusations, being needlessly subjected to search of my personal property without due cause, and physically touched by an acting agent of the corporation. I will be now pursuing legal representation to remedy this matter.Refer: Incident 240611-14249-16000-0001KCM193990Date of experience:June 10, 2024",1

Not only have they completely monopolized the entire commerce space but they continue to put small business owners out of business. This complaint is coming from a small business owner that was selling through the walmart seller central. I have been running ecommerce stores for over 10 years with Amazon and Etsy, and now Tiktok and I WAS with Walmart. They decided to end my account with absolutely no wrong doing, and they have locked up my money that is supposed to be paid out to me. This is a serious problem becuase thousands of dollars were already spent sending people products, and on shipping fees, and now walmart has taken my money hostage for over 2 months. This is corruption at it's best. Furthermore, they have no help for sellers and do not care about anyone operating inside of their business. They were fine to take the percentage that was their own, but will not release my thousands of dollars, instead they ignore support emails, and keep pushing back the time of release every 2 weeks. EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE NO REFUNDS OR RETURNS because every single order was delivered on time and quickly. This has to stop.

My experience wasn't just an isolated incident; it was a glimpse into a company culture that thrives on apathy and deceit.When a Walmart employee committed a FELONY against me, I naively believed the company would take swift action. Instead, I was met with a labyrinth of bureaucracy and broken promises.

They claim item was damaged during transit, and is undeliverable.  They will not send a replacement, the only option is a refund, which I will have to wait another 7-10 days for it to process.  I was invited to order it again once the refund clears, but I'd have to be a lunatic or a fool to do that.

The online ""experience"" is even worse than in-store, and has already taken up exponentially more of my time.

As a seasoned Vice President of Sourcing with over 15 years of experience in supplier selection, factory auditing, product traceability, and product testing, I have observed concerning changes in Walmart's approach, which now mirrors the one used by Amazon without sufficient oversight on supplier credibility and product traceability.The result is clear: products sold on WM.com either harbor incorrect or misleading information, or worse, infringe on intellectual property rights. A stark example of this is my recent purchase of what was purported to be Parfums de Marly Delina. This fragrance, belonging to the high-end, well-regarded French Perfumery House established in 1743, was found to be ""proudly"" made in China upon delivery—highlighting the issues of authenticity and product integrity.It is disheartening to see a reputable retail brand like Walmart neglect essential standards in supplier verification. The marketplace has unfortunately turned into a platform where anyone can sell anything, leading to American consumers being misled and potentially cheated. Ensuring credibility, traceability, and compliance with intellectual property rights is crucial to maintaining customer trust and retail integrity.I urge Walmart to reconsider its supplier selection strategy and implement stringent checks to guarantee product authenticity and safeguard consumer interests. Upholding these standards is not only vital for customer satisfaction but also essential for maintaining the brand’s reputation.Date of experience:June 10, 2024",1

Bought a pair of boots and wanted to return them after less than a month because they were not the most comfortable ones. When I went to return them with my credit card, they told me ""those boots have already been returned"".  I had never even tried to return them prior to that time. I asked them to provide me a date and time of a supposed return and got no reponse from an employee. Then, I found my original receipt and went to a different Walmart store to return it, and they told me the same story. They reffered me to call a 1-800 number. I knew they just wanted me to leave the store without getting helped because no item can be returned just by calling a number and not being in a store. Once again, they did not respond to my inquiry when were the boots ""returned"". If I had already returned the boots, then how did I have the boots in my posession in a pristine conditon accompanied by an original receipt? Someone else probably returned the boots prior to me buying them, Walmart had a glitch in their system or maybe thats how they treat customers lately. I was not spending a lot of money at Walmart previously , but I will not shop there at all anymore. I hope your higher lever managers see how your treat customers.

I go to the electronics checkout since that's what checkout is for. I've checked out my ink back there 3 times prior and have had no issues. I've dealt with one gentleman and two ladies. All three said it was ok to use the check out rather than trekking all the way up front. I'm standing there waiting by the register and there is a girl back there who has clearly seen me and refuses to come over by me. She said to me ""You can check that out up front."" I told her I know that but it's easier for me to checkout back here. She stomps across the floor, gets behind the cash register and starts pounding on the computer and slapping the keyboard. She throws the keys on the counter after unlocking the security box, and then throws them again. She doesn't even tell me my total, throws my ink a bag, and then THROWS my bag across the counter at me. She said absolutely nothing to me. I left the checkout stand around 10:16am. Her name tag was conveniently flipped over. I was going to report her but couldn't find anyone else around. So here is my customer service review. She had medium length brown hair, about 5'6"", and heavier set. Be weary of this employee if traveling to this Walmart. Hopefully Walmart can choose their employees more carefully in the future who respect their customers like the previous 3 workers I had the pleasure of meeting. All checkouts, self or human are meant for the customer.

Cathy Lunetta,2reviews,US,2024-05-29T22:50:06.000Z,"Straight Talk terrible customer serviceThis is regarding Straight Talk which Walmart and Verizon manage. They should be ashamed of these poor reviews that they are getting.We are a small organization that provides long-term housing to unhoused individuals. There are a handful of tenants who require a landline. A previous employee set them up with Straight Talk landlines. Getting information to pay the bill and to straighten out issues has been a nightmare. There is still one number that I cannot access on-line - even though we pay the bill each month.The recent concern has been with a dead modem. It took awhile to diagnose the concern. When I first called their customer service number I was told that it was within warranty and would be replaced free of charge. I was not told that it would not be replaced until the broken device was return. This happened on Saturday of Memorial Day Weekend. A few days later I happened to check my email and saw that I needed to take the broken device to UPS. Supposedly there was a free shipping label in the email. I could not open it. When I took it to the UPS store on Tuesday they also could not open it - even though it stated that they would be able to. It has now been over a week that our tenant has been without a phone.I called today to inquire about the shipping label. The person apologized and then sent me another one that had the same format as the first. She gave me a number that UPS could call when I got to the store to obtain the label. Well, this number that I called informed me that the modem was no longer under warranty and was not replaceable free of charge. That is why the shipping label was not available. Every other person that I spoke with assured me that it was under warranty. One person even told me that it was packed up and ready for shipping as soon as UPS scanned the defective one in. I wasted precious time traveling to the UPS, contacting customer service and assuring our tenant that it was in the mail.To top it off, I was then told that I could go to Dollar General, Walmart or Target to purchase a new modem. Again, I wasted time by going to 2 Dollar Generals to be told that they don't carry Straight Talk. Walmart did not have the item in stock at the store that I went to. I ordered it on-line for pickup this afternoon at another local store. An hour later I received a text saying that it was unavailable in the store and could be shipped to me in 2 days. Unfortunately I have little recourse but to wait until Friday. This is not ideal for our tenant who has enough on his plate.The lack of correct information is appalling and frustrating. Due to the small tight budget that we live on, we don't have other affordable options. As soon as I find one, I am dropping this service like a hot potato.Date of experience:May 29, 2024",1

There was a message saying my order was under $35 then a fee of 6.99 was applied. Mind you this didn't show up when I placed the same order before. I contacted walmart through chat again. I was told the $10 code can't be applied again. I was given $5 to help with the fee. So today I asked if the $10 can be placed in my wallet so I can use it to purchase the same items since I used the $5 code and only one code can be applied. I was told no! So I was inconvenienced the first time and can't use the $10. This is an insult and walmart is full of it. They should fix their website nobody should have to be wronged and don't get to use the codes given to them. This is not how you remedy a situation.

Each time I reached out, I was directed back and forth between Walmart and Angi, with no resolution in sight.Affirm Payment Complications: Since I used Affirm for the purchase, I contacted them as well. They also directed me to Walmart, resulting in a frustrating cycle of unproductive communication.No Refund: It has been weeks, and my refund of $194.00 for the canceled assembly service has not been processed. This amount is still reflected in my Affirm account, increasing my overall debt.Escalated the Issue: Due to the lack of resolution, I have filed a formal complaint with the Better Business Bureau (BBB). I also plan to leave detailed reviews to inform other potential customers about this negative experience.While the chair itself meets my expectations, the customer service experience has overshadowed my satisfaction with the product. I caution potential buyers to be wary of additional services and be prepared for possible difficulties in getting refunds or resolving issues with Walmart's customer service.Date of experience:May 21, 2024",1

She went over to her station and must have cancelled my order. She was very rude. I asked her if she cancelled it. I asked her for her name since she didn't have a name tag. She refused to tell me. She continued to get an attitude so I asked if I could speak to a manager. She then went off on me. I pulled out my phone and recorded it. I posted the video on YouTube under the name josephfranklin4003, if anyone is interested. Trustpilot doesn't allow links in reviews.The security worker in the Brosnan Security uniform who was holding the employee back tried to claim to be the store manager. I left after that. She then followed me out to the parking lot. I asked her to stop following me. Very unprofessional. I know Walmart has a tendency to have bad customer service, but this was beyond inappropriate.I called when I got home and asked to speak to the manager.

You go to the interview, and all goes well!! Then you don't hear from them until they send you your background check through the mail with your little misdemeanor. With that said, they make you feel like you robbed a bank, drug dealing, stealing, or even murder. But then Walmart has the audacity to hire illegal immigrants who doesn't know any English at all !! These are immigrants who are straight from Mexico, and even Ukraine!! So how the hell are they getting jobs, and I can't!! I've lived here all my life, but I have that little bitty misdemeanor that happened 4 years ago on my record. So I'm going to change my name to Anna Rodgrigez or Mykola from Ukraine, and try to apply like that just to see what happens, and if I get hired!! It's just no fair!! Our system is so backwards that Walmart would rather hire non English speaking Mexicans or Ukrainians instead of a hard working American citizen that has 20 plus years of customer service, cash handling, register knowledge, management, counting drawers down, stocking and anything that has to do with Walmart!! It's not fair for usI believe Walmart needs to give people like me a chance instead of sending a background check, and take a chance on someone, like me, who is hardworking and made one little mistake 4 years ago!! I applied for cashier position 5 months ago and was denied, not by a phone call, but again...... that background check in the mail!! I've seen body camera footage of so many Walmart employees getting busted stealing on the job or taking money out of the register!! Walmart has the best security system ever!! Ya'll have employees that are LP that there jobs are to just to watch the security monitors. I think as a large corporation such as Walmart, you really need to give some of these jobs to someone like me with just a little blip on their background!! Not turning them away and giving them to Helga whos plane just landed from Ukraine for the first time, but Helga get's a job at Walmart just like that without no experience in money handling, register experience, hell she can't even communicate with customers unless someone or her is using google translate, which makes her line longer.

Now Walmart seems to be more about price galging and sticking it to the customers they once cherished, the younger staff are rude and don't like giving assistance when asked. Returning items even with a receipt has become a hassle, and the money center is hardly open due to computers always being down. Produce and meats, are better off purchased elsewhere.

The transaction took place at Store #05280, and the TV was priced at $128.25, marked as clearance. Excitedly, we returned home only to find that the TV did not work at all.Promptly the next morning, my son and his wife returned to the store with the receipt in hand, expecting either a refund or a replacement as any reasonable customer would. However, they were met with astonishingly poor customer service. The supervisor they spoke to was not only unhelpful but also exceedingly rude. Despite presenting the receipt and explaining the situation, they were outright denied any form of resolution.It is worth noting that neither during the purchase nor on the receipt was it mentioned that the sale was final, nor was there any indication that returns would not be accepted if the item was defective.Following this disappointing encounter, I reached out to Walmart.com for assistance, only to be informed that it was solely at the discretion of the store to address the issue. Subsequently, I contacted the store directly, where I spoke with Areana. While she expressed understanding, her offer of a mere $20 Walmart gift card as compensation for our wasted time and inconvenience felt like a slap in the face.This experience has been particularly distressing given the circumstances my family and I have recently endured. We are residents of Portage, MI, and were directly impacted by a devastating F2 Tornado that ravaged our community.

That part of this Walmart is definitely a great place indeed. However, the spark part of this Walmart that oversees the online orders that customers make on spark has a major problem that needs to be addressed as soon as possible. Don't get me wrong, not all the workers in the curbside orders there are bad,  most are very helpful, take pride in their work, and are very friendly to the drivers, however as the old saying goes there is always a rotten apple that ruins the bunch. As a former spark driver, I must inform the future spark drivers and current on the problem that needs to be addressed. There is at least one associate (Ximara) that basically does not care about policies that Walmart incorporated had implemented to all Walmart stores in America. She is simply very self-centered and Moody to the point that she does not care about protocol. I will add that the policies state and I quote, “a driver is not allowed to leave the vehicle while the associate loads the customers vehicle.”  The employee hands  the drivers the  stickers for the orders so that they may scan on their app for each order that they have before delivering to the customer.  Unfortunately, this associate sometimes did not give the driver the stickers for the order,  would leave the vehicle door or rear hatch open or both, and would walk away without saying a word. This associate has also falsely accused a few spark drivers including me of using foul language so that their spark accounts would be deactivated. If a driver makes spark their main money maker, they would be devastated. Lucky for me I have other ways of making money, so spark was not my main source of income. Of course, I have written a former report to Walmart spark support and Walmart incorporated on this matter. I have also learned that the Lead (christine) of this Walmart seems to not care all the while turning their back on this issue. This has gone on from what I have learned for at least four months or even more. I do not care if I get my spark account back or not if this is what I have to deal with to serve customers then I do not want it back but I will make sure to inform all my friends, family, and many others about this issue so that they will be informed of what they must endure if they decide to sign up for spark in the future. Good luck to you all and have a wonderful day.Date of experience:May 01, 2024",1

Customer service was not very helpful, advice they gave didn't help. I asked to change instructions or help me with cancellation, but they said I probably can cancel but the seller decided to send it eventually. Instructions or addresses they couldn't change either.I ordered perfume and they had to deliver it to the cargo. The cargo asked for a call which Walmart as per the business instructions doesn't do. They just leave the order at the door.Then they blocked my account even though it was the first time I ordered. Nonsense. I didn't do anything to violate anything. What are you scared of?Now even though I cancelled my order when it was possible, they shipped my order. Hopefully, I will receive it because the customer service doesn't respond and I have no idea if cargo will pick it up.I always thought of this company as the best and most professional.

It was originally $273, so I paid for it quickly which led to me purchasing many other decor items for the lovely sofa. A while later, I got a tracking number that USPS was shipping my sofa? I thought Walmart had a new agreement with USPS to ship large items like sofas. When the tracking number showed delivered on April 5, it showed delivered in my mailbox? I knew a sofa couldn't fit in my mailbox, called the post office and was informed fraud involved, but the item that shows delivered was not sent to me,but another address, but she couldn't say where. She did say it only weighed 14oz. I cld WM explained fraud had occurred, but was reassured a replacement would come within 24 to 48 hours by supervisor, Mary. On April 6, cld to get the tracking number of replacement. Was told they had none. Another supervisor (Mateen) then said I would get sofa but that his ""back-end escalations team"" would contact me about it Mon. April 8. The 8th came and went. I had been informed contradiction after contradiction by non-cohesive, liars who are agents of WM. Soon afterwards was informed by email that the sofa was now being sold by another seller for $376.61?? The previous seller had been defrauding customers for a long time, so the seller was removed. Ethan also sent me an email stating I could pick out another sofa at no charge but it must be sold and shipped by Walmart. For hours I searched WM and finally found one. I sent the link and screenshots of the one I wanted. Ethan then contacted me back now refusing to honor yet another promise to ship another sofa of my choice, and I had not chosen a very expensive one either. WM is full of liars and ghetto-type, argumentative unprofessionals who interrupt constantly, and behave like they're in a street fight and must interrupt and get the last word. I continued to request a supervisor who is honest and follow through, but I guess they don't exist in WM. Their online or over phone chat are liars and do not honor agreements and promises previously made. They must be taught this unlawful business practice by their superiors. I have now been forced to file multiple legal actions and complaints against them which I am hopeful will promote justice in this matter. This is the most significant problem I've ever had with WM. I am disabled and let them know, and my living room is empty with all the throw pillows collecting dust in a corner. Evil is what their lawless behavior has been, nothing short of habitual liars who allow Asians to routinely use their site to commit fraud to customers.

Angela,3reviews,US,2024-04-09T12:09:02.000Z,"I recently ordered 2 dvd'sI recently ordered 2 dvd's, and I forgot to return them within 2 days.. I ended up calling the customer service phone number and I gave the guy my order number. At, first the guy said it would be no problem extending my days so I could return the DVDs and get my refund so as I'm talking to him and he said he would send me a bar code so that I would be able to return the DVDS. All of a sudden he changes his story and says now I'm not able to return my DVDs due to the fact that I was 2 days past and yet the 1 DVDs was unopened and the second DVD which was a used one which I never realized it was used in the first place...It's not right that at one point they say yes I will be able to return my DVDS, then his next breath they say no you can't return them....So, Walmart can shove my two DVD is up your ass to the sun don't shine and I'll be damned if I ever purchase a DVDs for them ever again along with I will be cutting down on my grocery shopping there, it seems  that every time I go shopping it ends up costing me between $200 and $300 out my freaky ass for groceries because of Biden and Walmart being so damn expensive in the first place, but they're supposed to be underpriced the hell they are the only thing under price about it is I'm giving my half my paycheck to them every damn time I go grocery shopping....So, Walmart is just as bad as a company as Amazon is... Second they always seem to be out of the stupid little things like deodorant so that means they have to place an order and it cost you because it's under $35 so they sock it to you on that way and then when you try to pick up through you know the ordering through the online where you place an order half the time that it always want to substitute your crap for more stuff that ends up costing you more money for the same things  for an example I order Little Bites Blueberry Muffins from Entenmanny""s and Walmart wants to substitute for Little Debbie's which is more costly than it is for me to get my little bites. I feel if I wanted substitute then I would request it to be substituted but before I learn how to do that I never knew that Walmart would substitute before without asking you, so they always would give me the substitute without  askinh me, and then it would cost me more money so now I make sure click on  that I do not want no substitutes at all... Another thing that pisses me off  about Walmart, I'm good enough to go through the store and do my  shopping ,and then when I get up to the self-checkout register that I have to bag it myself and put all my groceries back in my cart and then as I'm walking out the door and considering Walmart they just got done seeing me standing at the self-checkout  and they have the audacity to ask me for my sales receipt!Then  Walmart needs t go back to hiring  somebody to work to self checkout lanes because apparently they don't trust us enough as customers because you have those shoplifters that takes anything  theycan get their hands on so on the other hand if I'm trustworthy enough to stand there and check myself out then you guys need to do a better job of hiring somebody stand there at the damn register and check out and give me my flipping receipt so then I walk out the door they can see that an associate just handing me a receipt so I can walk out the damn door. Second Walmart bags have became so much more cheaper and yet there prices keep jumping... Also, why should I have to grade myself at the self-checkout when I  was the one who scanned my items and bagged them all my self...If Walmart wants us to score them, then let Walmart hire an associate to stand there and scan our items and bag them for us... Plus get some much better bags because I'm and I'm tired of the bags not lasting to me either getting out to my Jeep or when I'm trying to carry the bags inside of my house and I lose half the damn groceries in my yard because the bags ripped to hell so easily....If Walmart can afford to give Millions away to that freaking ass black lives matter hate group then they can afford to lower their prices and keep customers happy but they choose not to they choose to still have high ass prices and still give way too much money to Black lives matter the hate group that don't deserve one damn Penny because they're black and they feel they're so entitled to get every damn thing for free, so get off your ass go earn your own damn money and quit asking for charity like Walmart and all these other big corporations as well.....You don't see WHITE PEOPLE asking for a hand-outDate of experience:April 05, 2024",2

I have in the past asked if they can open a checkout which they have until now begrudgingly done. Today they point blank refused to open one. I am not a Walmart employee. It is not my job to operate their checkouts and when I have a large shop I will not use the self checkouts. I said to the employee ""keep it then"" and walked out. It is completely unreasonable for Walmart to expect me to put an entire weekly shop through the self checkout. Also this Walmart regularly charges more than that displayed on shelf pricing. When they do this they are supposed to give you the item free up to $10 or give $10 off the shelf price but never do.

I already knew that.  I asked what the store's policy was in this case.  Could I get an equicalent product fo the same price as he Hyper Tough?  NO!  Is there a store policy to deal with an advertised produce that was not in stock?  NO!After 45 frustrating minutes, I left, very annoyed.What's happened to Walmart?

Sarah Shipman,37K reviews,US,2024-04-04T16:29:28.000Z,"Walmart has gone downhillWalmart use to be great. They catered to middle and lower class. But the last few years, prices have jumped insanely. I get inflation, but they're higher than some of the stores that I use to avoid! My other issues as of late are that shelves are marked with ""new lower price"" or ""markdown "", but when you get to the register, it doesn't scan for that price. It's very scammy. If I go to self check out I hate to call the cashier over 4+ times, plus they have to verify every time. If I go in the standard checkout lane, they scan so fast that I miss what it rings up as most of the time. Plus, I shouldn't have to keep track. That's the job of the store.  Another reason I've given such a low rating is that there seems to be an awful lot of employees on the floor, but they're never actually working. I needed a toothbrush, which was locked up. I pushed the button and waited, did this multiple times for almost 20 minutes. Many employees walked past me. Many were in aisles around me. But apparently no one could open the locks to the toothbrushes. I also see employees texting on their phones all the time, and the conversations they have with eachother is usually NSFW. I feel frustrated when I'm trying to shop and I can't navigate an aisle because they have it blocked with stock. I get that they are filling shelves, but they should respect customers space. I am always given a look as if I'm bothering them. Why isn't stocking done over night, or early AM before they open? It would be so much more helpful.Date of experience:March 13, 2024",1

If I wanted 45 lb bags of dog food, I would have ordered them, but I ordered 50 lb bags of dog food. This is the 5th time in a row that they have done this and each time I am shorted $9-$12 of dog food, based on the cost per lb, and every time I have contacted customer service, I have not gotten any help or my request is just ignored and I never hear from anyone. This last time that I emailed support, a day or two later I got an email request to fill out a survey for the person who helped me, when I had not heard from anyone and this same thing has happened multiple times before. I emailed back 2 more times and my emails were just ignored. Then I emailed the CEO of Walmart and I still got no response at all. This is the second time that I have filed a corporate complaint with Walmart and they have not responded at all. Two years ago, my delivery was left at my garage in a puddle of water, instead of at my house door where they are supposed to be left. Getting my deliveries to my house door has been a problem for me so I put up signs everywhere telling them not to leave packages by my garages and one on the house telling them to leave the packages there and the packages were still left at my garage in a puddle of water so apparently the delivery drivers can't read and don't have any common sense not to leave packages sitting in water.  I contacted Walmart and asked for help with their shipper who left my packages sitting in a puddle of water.  I needed them to come back and move the bags of dog food to my house door before they were unusable because of the water they were sitting in. I am handicapped and cannot carry them to the house that was about 100 feet away. A few days later, I got another bag of dog food, that I had not ordered, delivered and stacked on top of the 3 bags sitting in water at my garage. Walmart had told me that I would have to return all the bags of dog food and that they would replace them. I quickly printed out the labels and attached them to the bags of dog food that needed to be returned so that they could pick them up when they delivered the next bag of dog food. They did not take them when they delivered it. I must have called Walmart 5 or 6 different times and every time I got a different answer on what I was supposed to do.   I was extremely frustrated and didn't know what to do and customer service said that they would have a supervisor call me back within 24-48 hours and waited for 2 weeks and I never got a call. I had told everyone I had talked to that I was handicapped and could not move the bags of dog food myself and when I went out and looked at the shipping labels I realized that the returns were for USPS but it was  Fed Ex, who had delivered the dog food. Walmart expected me to physically take these wet bags of dog food, which now weighed about 100 lbs each, to the post office to return them and I could not physically do that. After a couple of weeks, my dogs needed food and the only bag of the 4 that was salvageable was the one that was stacked on top of the other 3 bags that were sitting in water.  I couldn't get any help from Walmart at all. I had to hire someone to bring the good bag to my house and get rid of the 3 bags of dog food that were wet all because Walmart refused to call their shipper and have them come and move the bags of dog food while they were still good. I was also on the phone with Fed Ex trying to get them to come back and move these packages, but they never showed up and finally stopped responding to my calls, just like Walmart did.  A few months later, Walmart charges my credit card for the extra bag of dog food that they had sent me, and that I didn't order.  So now, I was out about $90 for the cost of 3 bags of dog food that wasn't any good and I had to pay someone an additional $20 to come to my house and take those really heavy bags of dog food and get rid of them because they weren't any good after sitting in water for 2 weeks. I wrote a letter to the Walmart Corporate office after I was charged for that extra bag of dog food since customer service would not even respond to me. I explained everything that had happened and they didn't even have the decency to contact me so it doesn't surprise me that they refused to contact me with the issue that I have now, which is also about dog food. Why even have a customer service department if they are not going to even respond to customer complaints, especially when someone takes the time to contact the corporate office because they can't get any help from the customer service department?  They are absolutely useless. I would give Walmart.com a score of zero if I could.  They don't care about serving their customers; they only care about making money, even if it means screwing over their customers.Date of experience:February 27, 2024",1

I was told it arrived 3/28/2024. I informed Walmart that I did not get it and asked if I could see the photo of delivery, as they suggest on the website if one does not get the item. I was then told it was delivered to the wrong address and was asked if I want a refund or the item resent. I said I want the item. I was then told the vendor had problems and is no longer a vendor. I saw the same exact item description and photo on Walmart.com for $199.95 fulfilled by Walmart and asked to have that one instead and not get a refund. Walmart refused and said they would issue a refund. I informed them that we have a contract, and they are legally responsible for breach of contract including the cost of the delay, all the time I have had to spend… but I’m willing to settle if they just send me the “Vitamix Stainless Steel Container” as agreed. Walmart put on a supervisor, who also refused, and hung up on me, so I purchased it directly from Vitamix who gave me free shipping and $25 off. Someone will eventually sue Walmart in a class action for such behavior and it will be costly. I would think Walmart would simply fulfill their contracts. I have had similar experiences with huge businesses like Citibank, which lost the huge class action lawsuit I warned them about and ended up giving me what I asked for as well as spending I don’t know how many millions of dollars, and a big construction company which could have settled by sending someone over to paint my cabinets that turned yellow, or by giving me a few hundred dollars to have someone do that, but instead told me I to go ahead and hire a lawyer, which I did, and they settled for $1.7 million dollars.

Larry Grant,1review,US,2024-03-23T18:46:02.000Z,"""Wally World"" Thomson, GaI use Walmart just like everyone else does, for grocery pickup, online orders or in store shopping. Grocery pickup - If I place an order and pick the items I want, I trust you to pick them the way you would for your household, well that thought sure is wrong. You get whatever they grab in their mad dash to pick an order not being picked up for several hours. Food that is damaged, open, has turned brown, or has black spots from starting to go bad is unacceptable. Look at the product you are picking for customers please, it's not hard. Substitutes I don't have an issue with, but when I park and walk in store to grab item I forgot to add to list and I check why my item was substituted and find lots of the product I ask for in stock, we have an issue. Again, please look before grabbing just anything. Online orders - I order stuff online and use the subscription now offered from Walmart to make sure I get in case store is out. Next day or two-day delivery is fine no issues. When item comes and it is damaged, and you need a refund or replacement can be a hassle. Most of time they just issue a refund, sometimes they want you to return it to store for a replacement, and you knowing store shows out of stock. Or you can have them pick it up return it and wait an extra week for it to come. I wish accepting pictures of delivery worked but I can see people using it for wrong reasons. I just contact the manufacture and explain details, along with pictures and get a better outcome taking care of the matter. Big price differences on items are a total red flag for me. Overcharging for an item and you know what the price range should be. Beware of scammer using Walmart seller front, they take your money, they send a package to a different address other than yours using USPS, Walmart uses Fed-ex not USPS. 88 lbs. of dog food with a tracking number being sent to NYC. The package weighed 7 oz. according to USPS using the tracking number. make sure it says sold and shipped by Walmart no matter how good the deal looks. In-Store - to many people, low stock, having to look for items other than where they should be. Paying higher prices than you can get online because Walmart store does not match online prices. Asking or waiting for help, then being told this is not my department let me find you someone, then you get told they on break you have to wait. No use asking a manager, regardless of what you have been told by an employee that you give the name of per your conservation with them. ""Poof, more of a headache than worth it for me"" I like Walmart and use it weekly, somethings I like, some I think needs improvements in areas.

P Shaw,1review,US,2024-03-15T15:46:03.000Z,"NIGHTMAREIt's unbelievable how incompetent Corporation this big can be and how they treat their customers. When you pay for a delivery service you're paying them for the service which means you should not have to contact them every single time you have something delivered. There is a place on the app to get a text notification which is nice because then you know if there's something not available or that needs to be substituted, when your orders on its way normal things that you would get when you pay for a service. Despite checking that box I have called over 20 times to request that they fix this problem because it's not on my end I get told it will be escalated and it will take three or four days yet still not happening. The people that deliver for them are not the ones that fought because they see my note now that says text or I will refuse the order. They also know that I order from their multiple times a week sometimes and I spend a lot of money there but that doesn't seem to matter to the big Corporation. If I place an order and have to keep going into my email to check and see if there's anything changed or when it's delivered why am I paying them for a service at all then I have to tip the person because it's not their fault. I have called the 800 number I have actually written corporate a couple times this week with absolutely no response, and I've been through this with this store for the last 6 months with other issues that are Beyond anything I've ever had to deal with in my life. You get told to return things to the store and you get there and the employees can't figure out why the card number thing is different yet you are showing them the same information and you get told to carry it all back out and call the 800 number. I had $300 worth of items then I got told that I needed to send it through FedEx but the employees at that store couldn't make the phone call themselves I had to step out of the line with a cart full of items to take back to my car. Finally got them to FedEx and takes eight days to get it to the point where they have it and they can initiate the refund but then hold my money for up to 10 days so at this point I've almost had a month of them having my money once again. The return process is a nightmare because it depends if it's from them or Marketplace or whatever but you have to check all that yourself because the 800 number is not going to do anything and definitely corporates not. They have you kind of stuck in some areas because it's the only major store nearby for convenience when the weather changes or you have an early morning delivery you shouldn't have to wake up and sit and check your email for an hour before it comes because nobody's going to tell you anything. Calling the store to ask for a manager is beyond ridiculous because you will listen to the phone ring for over an hour. The day I had to leave the store with all my items a manager came up while I was on the phone with the 1-800 number but she couldn't handle that I was very upset and walked away and then the 800 number hung up. I have paid for more items that I don't want or need because it's not worth the hassle. If you are late a day they can tell you they're not going to refund you the item even though you can show proof that you purchased it because you ran out of time but they can hold on to your money for that long? And if you're late with the return you're going to have to deal with that too but they don't have any responsibility for anything. At this point I feel like I should be getting a paycheck from them all the time I spend on the phone because they are getting paid as the customer I'm not I'm paying them for a service and then I'm calling every time. I haven't even told them to look at my records of how much money I spend, does not matter. And it should matter whether I spend a dollar or $500 but apparently not with this big Corporation. Then we're not going to go on to discuss the temporary hold that they put on your card because I've already heard there's a lot of issues with that and you could never figure out exactly what they're charging you for then take off anything that was substituted and might have a difference in price or you didn't get a chance to approve it because you have to keep checking the app. The normal process is you get a text message it should not be this complicated but I'm making sure I cover it all because corporate doesn't care and again calling the store to speak to a manager you're going to listen to the phone ring and if you're in the store they can walk away from you. I have never had to fight so hard and I question why I signed up for the delivery service but unfortunately sometimes it's not the easiest thing to get to the store when you need things and again I'm paying for it and it's supposed to be convenient for the customer not a Dumping Ground for nobody to care.

I made a mistake in entering credit card info while trying to order online. They flagged my account. Fine, but certainly easy to verify it was me & no fraud involved. I have estimated around 6 different dates & times speaking with help agents.  Each time I inquired why my account was still frozen (after waiting till the amount of days I was told it would be lifted by), they added ADDITIONAL days to my suspension. I completely appreciate the safety guards to protect our accounts from fraud! However, this could've easily been resolved, as it was MYSELF, on my established account with my cc's on file that were GOOD, just a mistake in entering info. I did not understand why, when I inquired after waiting the amount of days I was told, they extended the suspension EACH time. First 3 days, then another 3-5, and then another 10. The last agent told me he could shut down my account & open new one & that would resolve it.  He shut it down. I was unable to open new one cause it is linked to my email, which would not allow a ""new account"" with same email?!?! Very hard finding how to contact help after they shut down my account, cause you need an account to ask for help. Finally found help and the agent opened my account back up, said it should've have been closed. BUT, I was told it would be ANOTHER 10 days before I can order anything.  Ridiculous. I am still unable to place orders. I have had ZERO issues with my credit cards, nor any accounts I hold. This should've been resolved by now.

I ordered pretty early in the morning and I waited till after 12 to message them to find out. What's the estimated delivery time only to find out that the item is out of stock? Even though it showed in stock and they're having to reach out to other walmarts. And fulfillment centers. And it could take 3 to 10 business days before I could get my microwave. So ordering online is cheaper. However, it's best to just go and pick it up yourself. Because they do not know between the store and customer service. What the hell is going on? I have screenshots showing that the order was placed and that they were preparing it. And that the delivery wpuld be today. And then all the sudden after I talk to customer service. Now it's back to order placed. Because they don't have it in stock. Even though online, they do or they need to update their online services. Because it's incorrect and the only choice I had was to cancel the order completely. Wait for a refund which is gonna take the exact amount of time. It would take me to get another microwave Walmart, just sucks. I stopped ordering online. Because I had the similar experience with something else. And thought maybe they've improved. But apparently they didn't and they don't care about their customers at all. I suggest finding other alternatives to ordering online. Except for Walmart, because you're not gonna get your stuff. Not unless you go, pick it up yourself. So, yes, it's convenient and cheaper online, but if you want what you need that day, it's best to just go to the store. Which I won't be doing after this.

First of all , when items are delivered toy our home, they are left in view for people to steal and walmart will not refund your money. They often do not have their website delivery dates correct. They often send emails that items have been delivered and they haven't been delivered.: creating many unanswered for customers. Their website has many scram retailers on their site. Walmart doesn't proof read what these people are selling. For example I order  two pair of boots twice and never got them. When I was refunded, I noticed the refund amount was on the website was listed under another vendors name for one pair of boots.I brought this to te attention of Walmart. When vendors get caught scramming they rename their companies and go back on the websites under another name. Then their is the issue that happen to me twice, I have a camera on my property showing a delivery a very small item placed in my mail box. which turned out to be glue sticks but the vendor had on record that they sent out the shoes from the company but only sent glue sticks.That happen twice from the above scram company that was taken off Walmart website. Then there an issue with Walmart grocery delivery, they live the food any where and the food is not well pick especially fruits and vegetables. One day I came home and my food was in the driveway and some pass buyers were helping themselves to my grocery. Then again, if I return items a lot you get black listed, it's a person right to return items that they do not like. also if have many items not received either lost in transit or never delivered to your home Walmart holds that against you ,like you are liar when requesting a refund for  not received items. I have been a very loyal customer with Walmart on the website and in person in their store for many years, buying weekly. But these unfair conditions have completely turn away from Walmart shopping.

They said they dont have anyone that will take the order for 2 window shades. If you order shipping and a local store has it, they do not ship.They are supposed to deliver it themselves, but they will not, at least in Watertown NY. So, why did I pay for Walmart plus?

Tropicana Las Vegas, NV 89121.I was there 01/13/2024 and had at least $300 worth of household items in my cart.One I got to the register, things weren't ringing up at the price advertised. I had picturesof these advertised prices.And I don't mind walking down the isle with someone.Once we got to the towel sets they were also ringing up incorrectly so I said, call a manager or come with me down that isle so you can see the advertised prices.The Cashier called for someone named Sarah.The hand towels were advertised as $1.97 and ringing up as $2.97 so that should have been an easy fix.  Sarah took ONE LOOK AT ME and said those towels are $4 and I know that for sure.I said, then clearly you don't know much!The cashier stated to Sarah that the towels are ringing up as $2.97 and Sarah replied, AND THAT'S WRONG TOO!I asked for her to come with me down the isle and she said, I DON'T NEED TO BECAUSE I AM CORRECT ABOUT THOSE TOWELS BEING $4.Then this CLOWN - SARAH decided to walk to the next register and tell an employee something all of the customers in that area heard.She said, ""THOSE PEOPLE KILL ME CHANGING PRICES"".Her ignorance made me NOT WANT ANYTHING IN MY CART and so I left it at the register and went to the CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPT to report her and the manager they called was SARAH.When she walked up her attitude wasn't right, so immediately we got into it.  Until I told her to GET OUT OF MY FACE.  She walked away mumbling.I asked customer service to TRY AGAIN!They called LILA.While I waited, Sarah decided to walk back with more. I was on the phone with 1800 WALMART whenshe walked up saying, i just walked over there andas I stated, the towels are $4.00.I said, i have pictures YOU LIAR and i shared other thoughts since I watched her and she did not go over there!  JUST TRIFLIN!I stated and even the large towels aren't $4.00 besides that, DIDN'T I TELL YOU TO GET OUT OF MY FACE???She giggled and walked away and started gossiping with the employees near me so that they could turn around, LOOK AT ME AND GIGGLE. JUST TRIFLIN...Gossip is in every work place but it's being started by SARAH in this WALMART.Not only was she RACIST she was TIRED and TACKY!And as long as she works there, I am not shopping at any more Walmarts!  I am not even driving anyone to anymore Walmarts.They are not going!When Lila walked up, I got off the phone and showed her the pictures and she stated, the price should have been corrected.  I also shared the gossip Sarah is starting and the Racist Comment!I then said, here she come AGAIN!!!She had entirely too much drama!She came back up to say she went down the Isle and the towels are $4.  I watched her and she did not leave my sight..Lila and I both said at the same time, WALK AWAY!!!!So Sarah giggled and walked away.BECAUSE SHE WAS HAVING FUN SHOWING OUTHer ignorance was clear and THAT DRAMA and loud scene was started by her!She continuously, LIED, WALKED TO DIFFERENT EMPLOYEES TO KEEP THE DRAMA GOING, SHE KEPT COMING UP TO ME WITH HER LIE AND DID IT AGAIN WHILE SPEAKING TO LILA.So as I stated, she was Racist, Ignorant and Liar trying to over charge me BECAUSE OF MY ETHNICITY.She didn't need to do half of the things she did.  None of it was professional and she wanted it to remain LOUD in the store.HER BEHAVIOR HAS CHANGED MY MIND ON WANTING TO SHOP AT WALMART.I AM NOT SUPPORTING RACIST PEOPLE!So since Sarah walked up while I was speaking to Lila, I took Lila down that Isle and she saw more than one towel, that I wanted marked as $1.97 AS I STATED AND NONE OF THEM WERE $4.00 LIKE THAT CLOWN KEPT REPEATING!So it turns out that my honesty was being rejected by Sarah due to her Personal Feelings on African Americans.I am disgusted by her IGNORANCE & STUPIDITY.She WAS TOO LAZY TO WALK DOWN AN ISLE TO PRICE CHECK, WHICH PROVED THAT SHE DIDN'T DO IT LATER EITHER!!She just thought she could OVERCHARGE me.News Flash!  I am not going for it!!I took Lila down the isle it turns out that the towels were $1.97 NOT $4.00.I WAS TREATED LIKE WE ARE THE CHEAT, WHEN IT WAS SARAH THE ENTIRE TIME!WALMART HIRES THESE TYPES OF PEOPLE!Sarah tried SO HARD to get someone to believe her lie.  Why so much  DRAMA just because she did not want to walk.  Have some one else go then!  OH MY GOODNESS, SHE WAS EXTREMELY CHILDISH.SHAME ON WALMART FOR HIRING THAT!I reported her and you know what, WALMART DIDN'T DO A THING! I AM NOT SUPRISED.They want our money but they do not care if we are OVERCHARGED and DISCRIMINATED against.WELL THE JOKE IS OVER!I even spoke to the ETHICS DEPT and HR LAST MONTH and no one cared to call me back.I HAVE STOPPED SHOPPING AT WALMART.THEY ARE RACIST, GHETTO AND TRIFLING!Why should keep supporting them when this is what WE GET IN RETURN?THEY'RE FIRED AND WILL GET NO MORE MONEY FROM ME!Date of experience:January 13, 2024",1

willian karol bonora sant'ana,37K reviews,US,2024-02-06T22:02:50.000Z,"SubjectUrgent Resolution Needed: Non-Delivery of Laptop Purchased on Cyber MondayI am writing to express my deep frustration and disappointment regarding a recent purchase from Walmart that has significantly impacted my trust in your company. On Cyber Monday, I purchased a laptop, which, according to FedEx, was delivered and signed for at my address. However, this is completely untrue as I was present in my apartment the entire day, working from home, and received no notification, knock, or delivery attempt. Furthermore, the signature FedEx claims to have obtained does not match mine in any respect—they mentioned a signature under the name ""Wsant,"" which is not how I sign my name, and have failed to produce any evidence of this supposed delivery.The lack of resolution from both FedEx and Walmart in this matter has been both astonishing and unacceptable. Despite numerous attempts to resolve this issue, contacting FedEx 5-6 times, and reaching out to Walmart for support, I have been met with nothing but a cycle of blame-shifting, with no concrete steps taken to investigate the matter or refund the cost of the laptop that I never received. This situation has forced me to incur additional expenses to purchase another laptop from another merchant due to the urgency of my needs, further compounding my financial loss and inconvenience. The laptop was delivered by UPS with no issue.It is deeply concerning that Walmart would consider this matter resolved based on a delivery claim from FedEx without any verifiable proof, especially when the customer (myself) has consistently reported the package as undelivered. This oversight not only questions the efficacy of your delivery verification processes but also highlights a glaring disregard for customer satisfaction and service reliability.I reside in an apartment building in Alameda, California, where it is standard practice for deliveries requiring a signature to be personally handed to the recipient. Unfortunately, it appears that this procedure was grossly neglected, resulting in my current predicament. My building, being small and easily navigable, with only three floors and an elevator, should not pose any significant challenge for delivery personnel attempting to fulfill their duties correctly.I urge Walmart to take immediate action to rectify this situation by conducting a thorough investigation into the delivery of my laptop, liaising with FedEx to uncover the truth behind the supposed delivery and signature, and issuing a full refund for the laptop that was never received. It is imperative that Walmart acknowledges and addresses this failure in service delivery to prevent future customers from experiencing similar distress.Your prompt attention and resolution to this matter are crucial. I await your response and a satisfactory resolution.Date of experience:December 04, 2023",1

Their computer wanted to charge most of it to my debit card...not to my EBT card even though most of the items were EBT SNAP eligible. So I did not complete the payment. I removed all of the food items and just left about $40 worth of other store items in the order. It said I had 20 hours in which to add more items. Which I did decide to do. MOst of the links along the path to doing that said ""EDIT ORDER."" But complete editing is NOT an option. You can only ADD things to your order.  Also, in ""editing"" my order it was hard to find out how to order more than one. I tried it a couple of ways, backtracking and side tracking, guessing...and found a couple of ways. I added one. But it did not show up. So I took another path and tried adding one more in quantity to that item. Meanwhile their computer decided to add the first one...and I ended up with 3 when I only wanted 2. Customer service chat said she couldn't delete that unwanted quantity, So SHE could not ""EDIT"" it either. BUt she gave me a $10 bonus coupon to use on my next order from Walmart. BUt I don't want to use Walmart again. I used to ise them a  lot, but as things got worse, I shited to doing most of my business with Amazon and Hannaford. Then I started using Temu a lot. I think the big two--Amazon and Walmart have salted the internet with a lot of trash about Temu, because they are cutting into their business. The accusation about their using slave and prison and child labor is not true. They DO buy some stuff from the PROVINCE where some prison/slave labor is used. But there is no evidence to show that Temu's products are made by the prisoners.  I once owned a very successful small lunch-catering business in my small city. It was cutting into the other big restaurants' business. They got together and paid off the chief of police to intimidate me. He had no legal footing but he was so frightening I shut down.

(Or maybe there's a price cutoff - my items cost about $185 - perhaps they refund only if it's less than a certain amount?) In any case, customer service insisted the items were delivered but I did not receive them. They did not include a photo with the ""was delivered"" email. However customer service insisted THEY had a photo of the items at my residence. ""Really?"" I said. ""Then please send me the photo.""

Instead, we got rich corporate oligarchs destroying everyone else's quality of life more every year through increasing wealth inequality.You can thank economic monopolies that corporations like Walmart have to oppress lower-class citizens.It's these Walmarts, dollar stores, fast food restaurants, outsourced jobs, and other things that destroyed the middle class to enrich a few rich white men. It's only about improving quality of life for a few rich white men while everyone else suffers. The 2008 recession and COVID made this wealth inequality worse. Walmart was profiting off of people's suffering during 2008 and COVID.I'm tired of people saying the west is great. It's controlled by rich white men who destroyed the middle class and did violent economic sanctions. These rich white men have created a culture of zombified consumerism in the west that does environmental disaster when Earth has limited resources. Walmart is contributing to this zombified consumerism, environmental disaster, and middle class destruction.Younger generations are living in their cars or parent's homes because rich white male boomers made house ownership and paying rent harder to accomplish with the help of Walmart's dystopian wages.Walmart also has awful customer support service and allows delivery truck drivers to damage people's deliveries. This is not a society built on trust, respect, honesty, stability, and quality standards. It's more of an economy ran by workers who barely know what they're doing because standards have declined to keep corrupt people in power.I used to buy products that would last long, run smoothly, and be sold by companies with good customer support service from Walmart. That's no longer the case most times. But this is the case for an increasing amount of companies. So, it makes me hate shopping when people are ruining everything for profit. So, I hate the fact that kids are going to end up getting malfunctioning products on Christmas day. It's pretty sad where this so-called society is heading when profit matters more than making kids happy on Christmas. It's showing this so-called society cares about profit more than their own kids.

The store swore they had sent 8 plates, but offered no proof. I suppose that they do not monitor this process with digital records.

The Walmart Online app was initially good but the fruits and veggies received were often molded and sometimes containers (like mozzarella cheese in oil) were cracked and leaking.  I took photos and these items were refunded, and I added a note to my instructions emphasizing NOT to give molded or damaged items.  As this continued to happen still, I noted that the Walmart Online started asking for me to return the items.  This is fine if it is an item which won’t mold to the point that the room smells because now I have to wait maybe a week to drive to a Walmart (weekend needed as I am too busy during weekdays) to return a molded fruit or veggie.  But the whole point of paying for an online service is to not have to go to a store.  In my case, there are reasons why it is difficult  for me to get to the local Walmart.  That is why I got the online app.  So, Walmart delivers molded food and then harasses customers by making them drive to Walmart to return an item which should not have delivered molded or damaged in the first place.  So, the online grocery shopping is a hit or miss experience and the online refund department experience has been a very negative one.  Thank God for a nearby Trader Joes.  Their prices are higher but at least the items are all very good and the customer service is excellent.  Having done hundreds of dollars worth of groceries over just the last few months at Walmart, I would have hoped they they would not harass or cheat customers by giving them bad products in the first place.

Because of the distance, I'm limited on grocery items - that's a bummer - would love to order it all and get it delivered same day. I haven't had an order that I would consider to be a snafu. The site is very easy & quick to use. Being a + customer has paid off for me. Most of my orders are received in a reasonable time frame.

There aren't many Walmart's to begin with, so you're limited to the one store that's near your town and the quality is horrible. Constant sold-out items, even if listed online, also the produce is horrible. The vegetables will already be spoiled when you buy them and cook them immediately.

They were acting as middleman for a company called CTS Warehouse at Suite 1, 20 Troy Rd Whippany, NJ 07981, USA. 201-580-4026.Late in December of 23 I started having startup problems with this unit. I started calling and calling the customer service and tech support people at Apple and they would have me try this, that, and the other thing, and, guess what, nothing worked.I started getting pink and yellow victorian stripe wallpaper behind the sign-in spaces. I would sign in and the little bar would start going across the screen as the unit attempted to start up. I kept calling Apple and in early January(24) they referred me to an Apple authorized service provider in Los Alamitos California.I took the unit there and paid 35 dollars to have him run a 2 hour battery of diagnostic tests. Later that day, or the very next day, I can't remember which, he called me back and said that the graphic processor chip on the motherboard was going bad and that was why I was having startup problems.He explained to me that he would have to try and find a refurbished motherboard for it since apple does not support this obsolete model anymore. He also said that this would be a very expensive operation costing in the 350 to 500 dollar range. I was of a mind to do that at that time.I think it was the next day that he called me back and said that he could not find one from any of his supply network personnel. I started to realize that this was not going to work and very soon after that another opportunity to purchase a much newer unit with a much more reliable corporate entity than the seemingly fly-by-night operation that Walmart has chosen to work with.In closing, I picked up my unit a week later and it seemed to start up right away this time and I thought that just maybe they fixed it but no, it went back to the previous problem behavior with in 2 days after I had it back in my possession.The other day I bricked it by resetting it to factory specifications, erasing the hard drive and shutting it down. Now it is a brick, a shell of a once functioning machine. I contacted a tech recycling company and inquired as to whether they could help me to recycle this dead unit.As the old saying goes, fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.

The Paramount + benefit is for the Paramount Essential program only. First, you have to cancel your current Paramount subscription. Then you get a seriously toned-down version. There was an option to update, but the link didn't work. Called tech support and they agreed saying that they would fix it and send me an email. Nope! In order to get the programming that I was used to, I had to sign up for Paramount + under a different name. Then I discovered that it costs more than what I had in the first place.To make matters worse, the home delivery from the store link is disabled. I live only 5 miles from our nearest store. Signed up for this strictly because I need home delivery of my groceries. Nope, not happening! I tried to contest this through my credit card to no avail.

The order was processed with a payment issue, but fine.  Now the disaster:1. The shipping tracker says the package will arrive on 01/12.2. On 01/12 I received a txt saying the package has been delivered by 2:33pm,  but the txt was sent to me around 1pm.3. I chatted to an online Walmart agent, asked about what's going on, didn't get any useful info.4. After 2:33pm, the online shipping status shows the package was delivered.  Again, none received.5. I chatted to another 2 Walmart agents, they found some error and asked me to call the shipper (pilot)6. Called the shipper, they told me there's an error and the sofa was never even picked up!  Now they told me to call Walmart for a resolution7. I then chatted with another 2 agents, and they repeated the same questions, and provided zero support.  The 2nd agent even left the chat half way in our conversation?!??8. I finally called the customer service, and they referred me to a customer care team member.  The lady said they could not issue a refund (I didn't even ask for one), but suggested me go to my finance institute to dispute the charge (really???), and she also told me that the shipping issue will be resolved.I doubled checked that if I will still receive the sofa, and got a positive confirmation and she also provided an estimated delivery date (01/16).9. On 01/16,  of course the package was not delivered. So I called the customer service again,  and the agent told me to hold while she is looking up the case.  Then the auto voice told me that the wait time is 34 minutes???!  Turns out she just left the conversation and referred me to another agent10. after 20min, a guy joined the call.  Provided me the same answer that they cannot issue a refund but I should go to my bank to dispute the charge.  I made it clear that I do not want a refund but want my sofa, and Walmart owes me an explanation of what's really going on here.  Without finishing my question, he just hung up.I ended up chatting/talking to 7-8 agents, waited more than 3-4 hours total, and repeated the same info multiple times, and still, the issue was not resolved and no one seems to know what's going on.What's worse? Walmart agents can decide to leave the chat or hang up the phone directly while the customer is still speaking.  This is 2024 and I am not how this business is still running.If this is the service (if you can still call it service) Walmart is promoting, I foresee this business (at least their online department) will go non-existence in no time.Date of experience:January 16, 2024",1

Walmart also doesn't accept all the major ways to pay. They make you download their app instead of just making it convenient for everyone, even people with Apple Pay. This was really unfortunate to learn while grocery shopping last month. Give people options and freedom to buy their things electronically even without your app. Let people download your app because they want to not because they are forced to.

Returned to Walmart Rep stated that service was not handle in Walmart and to call the 18005384389 12/2023.  Returned 1/7/204 Team Leader read the printed information.  She proceeded to say that it noted the word ""likely"" covered by the manufacture Brilliance Fine Jewelry.  She wrote down the contact information for me to contact the manufacture. I explained I did not want a refund and my purchased warranty for next 3 years was not in question.  I had the produce less than 1 year.The Team Leader tried to give a non-negotiating response for this situation.  My question is if this has happened before why is this a problem that continues with Walmart?  I left Walmart without reasonable customer service or care in Villa Rica, Ga.  The consumer has to do all the telephone contacts and return over and over to Walmart only to be turned away after Walmart has taken my money, and Walmart provide substandard service.  I could have contacted my credit card and reported this to them and received better results.   ???Since the original owner of Walmart/Sam's is deceased the philosophy has changed due to changes in place following new CEO's, family/board members and others.  It is awful not accepting responsibility at the Walmart franchises.  It seems the decisions today are based on not the customer but on DOLLAR profits, long line, poor staffing, lack of items for sale on the shelves, misplace items causing error at registers, rude/lazy staff, poor training for your staff and we hear ""I don't know"".... not to mention higher prices which they should or could stop blaming the Covid, the economy, thefts or others.  You are robbing us every time we try to use Walmart as a go to store in our neighborhoods.  Maybe if we stop honoring Walmart and go to Kroger's or other supermarkets then you will hear us loud and clear.Date of experience:December 29, 2023",1

My husband recently passed and I've lost his income.  I joined Walmart membership to save time and money.  Here's the thing they do NOT disclose.  They tack on a ""tip"" for the driver.  Here in CA, businesses are required to pay minimum wage, which is now $20 an hour.  More than I make.  So I order from Walmart, and I get an added on 20 percent tip for delivery.  Amazon is FREE delivery ... no tip.  This is really leaving a bad taste in my mouth.  If I choose to not leave a tip, will the driver not deliver to my front door?  Will the driver take things out of my order?  Will the driver leave my stuff on the sidewalk?  What do other seniors do when they have a hard time getting to a store and sign up for $98 a year for Walmart's ""supposed"" great membership and then all these added fees?  Mind you, not everything is deliverable.  Plus, when ordering groceries, we HAVE to order $35 worth in order to get free delivery but in reality, it's not FREE because there's always a 20% tip added on.

I picked up about $68 dollars’ worth of items, check out via self-check-out and headed towards the exit where a Walmart employee stated to me that I had to show a receipt before I would be allowed to leave the store with my purchases.  I told the employee that I didn't have a paper receipt because when I checked out I was given the option of getting a paper receipt, text receipt or email receipt.  Silly me opted for the email receipt and I told this to the employee.  He then stated to me that I had to pull the receipt up on my phone and show it to him.  I then told the employee that my phone was still in my car because I did a quick in and out.  The employee then attempted to call a security officer to detain me.  I then noticed that Walmart employees were only asking African American customers for a receipt and not make this request of the few Anglo-Americans who walked past me.  There were at least two other African American customers who had been stopped and told that they would have to provide a receipt in order to exit the store.  I got upset once I observed all this and then told the employee and the security officer that I would be more than happy to show a receipt to a judge in a civil or criminal proceeding.  I then proceeded to leave the store.  I then heard a Walmart manager say to me that I could not return to that store.Date of experience:January 05, 2024",1

Walmart is intentionally misleading their so-called loyal customers.   It has become such a hassle to shop at Walmart. I live in Princeton Kentucky - a very small town and not much else here. The stress with every single order is overwhelming. I  have learned only this last year that I must check and recheck that Walmart charges the right amount - the right amount actually goes to the bank. Sometimes it doesn’t.   Start the process again.  I have Walmart card for us so called loyal customers. Pay over $100 yearly to get free shipping. What a joke.  I was charged probably $1,000 in shipping fees I did not know about.  Freight fees of $18 that show up sometimes a month later for a two dollar item that I ordered because it was only $2.  Makes no sense.  December 31 my receipt shows I checked out inside at 6 pm.  Discovered on Jan 3 that I did not make it home with my wallet . The last place I had it was Walmart.  Called and described my wallet.   Yes!  It was there.  I had just closed an account at our local bank (because of theft)  Reopened new account.  Cashed $1,500 in checks added it to some money already in my wallet.  I had organized it before I went to Walmart.  My friend sue offered to go pick it up for me.  I was so thankful.  Talked to employee on phone after Sue arrived describe wallet told my name and said it was OK for Sue to pick it up Manager was furious that the wallet was laying out and had never been locked up.  Thankfully Sue had the wherewithal to open my wallet in front of the employees and not one dollar was there. One employee said it's been here 4 days.  That is an odd statement. Implying that the length of time OKs theft. It was turned in to the service desk. The rules say to lock it up immediately.  Walmart is responsible for keeping it safe until it was claimed.  It had remained on a desk from December 31 at 6 PM until Wednesday January 3 about 11 a.m.   The manager was furious understandably because it was not locked up.  Told Sue I should call the police I reported it to the 911 operator and was told I would hear from somebody in a few hours probably.    I never heard from anyone. I called the manager about 3 o'clock.  He got snappy.  Said he was doing me a  favor (yes he said that!) and that  he shouldn't even be searching the tapes before police arrived.  Another rule broken.  He said he had been looking at the tape for hours and just gotten to wallet being turned in.  I told him what time I was there and he said no one told me that but my friend had.   Why did he search the tape before the police got there.  10 minutes later he called me back (after telling me it would be hours and maybe days until he was finished reviewing) and  said that wallet was not touched. He said nothing about seeing me checking out or where my wallet  was picked up and who turned it in implying he was in no way responsible for the theft.  I was wanting to know if he saw me checking out if I had my wallet,  did I leave it at the checkout desk or did he see me drop it and who turned in. To me he skipped the main part. I do know the employees know that there are cameras and where they can go not to be watched.  I hope the manager is an honest person.  In my opinion and from what I've seen Walmart is not honest and their employees are not honest. I've dealt with this for months now I am always told by Walmart that I am valued and they appreciate my business but words mean nothing actions do.  Another two hours of my time writing this review does Walmart not think my time is important.  So actually it's costing me about 10 or so extra hours a week just to be a Walmart customer I don't like that.

All the boxes at the store were opened and retaped shut. The store associate assured me they check the boxes before closing them. On Christmas day my son discovered the scope was missing. I returned to Walmart in Emporia with the pellet gun and the receipt. The customer service desk woman was dismissive and rude and just simply said they are final sale and she cannot return them. I tried to explain I did not want to return it, I wanted the scope that was to come with it. I asked for a store manager. Michelle (she said was her name but she turned her badge around so I could not see her name when she saw me writing down names) did not allow me to explain or speak before giving me the same rude and dismissive attituded. She simply stated they are final sale. I told her I do not want a refund. I want the scope. She got hostile and aggressive. She refused to offer any solutions, expecting me to just pick up the gun and leave. I specifically asked her what it was she expected me to do to resolve the issue as the box was opened (which all the boxes were which is concerning if these are final sale items, why are the boxes opened?) and parts that I paid for and expected to be in there were missing. She just said call 1-800-Walmart. She treated me like I had no right to ask for the issue to be fixed let alone upset the package did not have all the parts it was supposed to have. Like this was my fault. I have never had someone be so rude, disrespectful, and aggressive when all I was asking for was a solution. I walked out of the store feeling abused and emotional. It did not have to be like that. I am a human being and a customer. What happened to customer service? When did it become ok to abuse customers when they are trying to discuss and resolve an issue? When did it become lawful to sell something as final sale and not verify all the items are in the box before sale if the box is open? My son was very disappointed on Christmas and since we are visiting I was only able to get the one gift as we only have so much room in our luggage. As it is I have to pay an additional $30 to ship the pellet gun home and it does not even have all the parts. Walmart created a negative experience for us in VA over Christmas and I am very disappointed. I will be avoiding Walmart at every chance I get in the future. Walmart is not known for its great quality or customer service but the abuse and disrespect I received at this Walmart went way past what I have ever experienced before. I will be filing a complaint with the BBB and I have already provided feedback to Walmart on their store but who knows if they will even bother to review it let alone do anything about it. I am sad for my son who wanted this pellet gun for a couple years now. I was so excited to give it to him just to see the disappointment on his face that the one piece that made the gun so exciting was missing and that I would not be able to get him another one till return home so he was not able to play with his cousins while they had theirs.

I was confused by the tracking because it had no proper map and the lcar image kept going all over without regard to the way streets are.I waited anyway. After the 4th time change I saw a man with a Walmart bag approach the door.  I 1st thought it couldn't be mine because there was no box of cat litter.  I then saw a bottle of laundry spray which I had ordered this morning the 26th.  So it was mine but NOT the one I was expecting.So I immediately contacted assistance and this one kept needing to  be corrected as to which order and items I had Not received.  Eventually she got that straight but then kept telling me only thing she could do was to cancel and file a complaint about the issue and the store specifically.The assistants who had heard me give the whole story to had sent it to a department that investigate complaints and told me that if it happened again/continued that it would be  sent to be seriously investigated.However that last 3 assistants who ""helped"" me today did not allow me to give full story. I got impression that they were impatient and only believed that cancelation was only thing could be done.I am not going to do any more business with that particular store in Louisville as they have difficulty delivery to me. Tho they did deliver an order on Saturday the 23rd to someone else who lives in same building as I.I am also definitely going to use other sources for same day deliveries as I have no difficulty with specific other sources.I always had doubts about  Walmart.  This months  non deliveries/ issues with same day driver's has proven them to be true.Unfortunately, people still believe in this store and so always give  me their gift cards.  Which means that I will still shop there.I have changed my primary store to another one that is actually closer but in another state.  Tho I prefer to support my town's economy and not another state.Date of experience:December 26, 2023",2

Good variety of products, affordable and reasonable pricing. My experience with store delivery has been a good one. It's very convenient and good to have for people who do not have their own transportation and would have to take public transit, which to the nearest Walmart round trip for me is 3hrs by public transportation; and it saves money on paying for cabs, Uber or Lyft. There have been 2 occasions I didn't receive the item quantity I bought. I contacted Walmart chat and I was refunded with no issues. Once in a while, the delivery has run late but I received my delivery within 4 hours past the requested delivery time I chose.  I've been given Walmart credit without requesting it cause of late delivery as well. I'm happy and thankful they offer this service.Date of experience:December 25, 2023",4

I explained to her that the item was supposed to be $6.99. She blatantly ignored that. So  I went back and brought another one which she  scanned at $9.99. She called another associate over who also scanned the item for $9.99. They both looked at each others as though I was trying to pull a scam. Neither bothered to go to the nearby aisle to check the advertised price. they just walked away.

Walmart has blamed their mistake on our local store and now on our bank even though there is more than enough proof that the whole thing started with Walmart.com.

They told me they would ajust the price (and make me pay the discounted price instead of the full price).So I purchased the seats again, and when I wrote back to walmart to give them the new order number, they told me someone would call me in 72 hours at most to ajust the price.I received the seats at home a few days later(and paid them full price). I wrote to walmart again 3 times to remind them to ajust the price.A whole week after I gave them the order number, they finally called me, to tell me they wouldn't ajust the price. :) I tried to explain that an other employee had told me to buy the seats again and had promised I would get a price ajustment, but the person on the phone only repeated I would not get a price ajustment.So now (cause I never meant to buy the seats if they were going to be full price), I have to go back to walmart again with my newborn to return two car seats that I wouldn't have bought if walmart hadn't told me to do it.This is completely ridiculous. You are a joke.Date of experience:December 15, 2023",1
John,1review,US,2023-12-15T13:35:29.000Z,"I encountered an issue while attempting… to buy gift cards for my company Christmas partyI encountered an issue while attempting to purchase a set of gift cards at Walmart. Upon reaching out to customer service, I was informed that there is a limit of two gift cards per day. I find this policy to be quite unreasonable, as other establishments such as Target or Dillons grocery store allow for the purchase of a higher quantity of gift cards, including up to 10 gift cards worth $200 each, and an additional 2 gift cards valued at $400 each.It is important to note that the credit card machines in place at these establishments are designed to ensure the security of the transaction, by verifying that the cardholder is indeed the legitimate owner of the credit card. This system greatly reduces the risk of fraudulent activity.In light of this, I believe it would be beneficial for Walmart to reevaluate their current policy regarding the purchase of gift cards. By allowing customers to buy a more reasonable quantity, while still maintaining the necessary security measures, it would enhance the overall shopping experience and potentially attract more customers.I will be my shopping at Target from now on. since Walmart is behind times.Date of experience:December 14, 2023",1

I then remembered I needed to go to the other Walmart, 5 miles away, and as I was creeping so slowly in December 13, 2023 at Chelsea, AL Walmart Parking Lot, so very carefully as not to hurt anyone, I stopped at the White Line with the Big Capital Letters that say ""STOP"" as I have for over 17 years, and no one was behind me the whole time, and then as I turned my head right and started to go left, looking both ways to go to the Traffic LIght, she raced by my vehicle ignoring the ""STOP"" Line painted permanently fore a very long time in the lot and shot buy me within inches of hitting me from behind and then proceeded to exit the parking lot but was stopped by traffic in front of her before she could  proceed.  If she would have hit me, it would have crippled me for life.  I have her license plate, but since she did not cripple me, or hit me, I cannot report it except to Walmart, here.  She was speeding, and she did not even roll down the window and apologize.  If it was a mistake, she could have apologized.  It was like road rage or crazed, and I was being so very careful.   You just cannot predict what people will do even on your finest behavior, you could get killed or injured just going to the grocery store where you live for over 18 years.  Very scary, and then the traffic, which is never this bad at 9:30 a.m. swarmed me the entire way home.  Not normal at all for this time of day, Wednesday, weekday.  And this parking lot is usually very safe and curtious drivers 99 percent of time.Date of experience:December 13, 2023",4

Mary Morris,4reviews,US,2023-12-13T14:54:34.000Z,"What went wrong this time- In Store shopping Zion ILWhat went wrong this time? Is a question that you have for one star reviews. Before writing this review saw that you had a lot of one stars. Wondering if it's just during the holiday season or as always not enough customer service. I am thinking more so of not enough customer service in that they are in a rush in that is what leads to the one star.My story starts on December 9, 2023 like any customer going out to get some things from the Zion, Illinois Walmart store (NOT ONLINE). I had placed a DVD with the other things in the cart. I had headed up to pay for these items. I did not use the automatic scanner and actually used a sales associate. I thought everything was going well at that time in checking out. Like everyone we are in a rush and on my part I did not pay attention to where that DVD was placed. Just assumed that it was bagged and had grabbed it to put into the cart. There was no need to rush due to fact that we where not in any long lines. When we got home like usual after shopping we emptied out the car. Had multiple hands helping in unloading. At that time didn't think anything about that DVD until Monday when wanting to get it out. At first thought that maybe, just maybe it was left out in the car. I tore that car up front in back and no luck in finding it. Then we looked all over the house and asked other family members and sadly to say no one has seen it. Now we are questioning how it was bagged and with what else that it was purchased with. We took two days looking for this item and re going over between the house and the car trying find this item before going back to the store. I went back to the store on Tuesday, December 12 to customer service. The lady was nice enough to go thru the security camera and there binder to locate that dvd.  Between both areas was told that I had gotten that item. I had thanked them multiple times and headed back home to continue my search. I found that I am still looking and still without that item. Now  my question is what item do you think I have? Answer ZERO!!! Happy Holidays to those suckers that shop at Walmart!  Lesson learn watch what is being bagged and make sure you  grab all your bags before leaving the store. On my part I knew this but didn't follow this so I screwed myself over. I will be going elsewhere to pick up this DVD. I have had other issues with Walmart and I think it's time to find another place to shop. I don't use the Zion, IL Walmart much and don't think it would be that much of a loss.Date of experience:December 09, 2023",1

They promised to honor the original sale price at a later date, but this assurance turned out to be empty. This isn't just a one-off incident – it's part of a frustrating pattern where my orders get blocked for no clear reason. Walmart.com Corporate (Customer Care person, M.) emailed me on 12/9/2023 asking to call back to remediate.

I have been a very good customer and shopped with Walmart since they first opened.  In the last 3 months, since being bullied out of Mercy Hosp., Perrysburg, Ohio by an E.R.nurse by the name of Gordon and his supervisor (nobody would give me their names).  I really need an attorney, but, back to my story with Walmart.  Since I left the hospital I have no brakes on my vehicle, am homebound and can only walk appr. 3 feet before collapsing due to the embalyism.  I have no family, live alone and stay to myself.  Since I am unable to drive to get groceries I had to find an alternative way to purchase groceries, diapers or anything I need.  I decided to pay Walmarts preferred program to have items, groceries, etc. DELIVERED to me.  I have been a good customer and was a happy customer until the Black Friday deals of 2023.Walmart blasted their 43"" ONN TV over the TV every 5 minutes. So, being the preferred customer I am I was supposed to be I was able to shop early at noon for this special.  I stayed up all night to make sure I would be the first one to order their great buy, which I did. At noon I pushed that button and was put in line, I continued to order my delivery and cashed out.  They grabbed my money immediately and when I received my delivered order the same day to my surprise the Perrysburg, Ohio store did not send me my $99.00 plus tax 43"" ONN Tv but sent me a 32"" ONN TV.  I guess this was false advertising.  I did not want this TV so I immediately tried to return it to either get what I ordered or a $106.00 refund.  To my surprise this has been the nightmare from hell.  I have gone online, called every dept in all of Walmart and spent more than 30 straight hours, talked to and chatted with over 57 employees and been lied to, cussed out, transferred from dept to dept and hung up on so many times I can't see straight.  They refuse to come come pickup this tv or send me a FedEx label(I do not have a printer) and cannot return this tv to the store.

I received notification as normal except when I received a text stating my items were delivered though the photo clearly shows them in the back of the drivers vehicle. They were never delivered. I contacted Walmart, they said it would be 10 days to refund, but to order express and they would send me a $10 promo code and I waive the delivery charge. I did so. The groceries were picked out, and were in process. I saw they were ""checking out"" and then all of a sudden get a text they are delayed. Today (12/6/23) I called Walmart at 0700 to figure this out. Between going back and forth from the store, walmart.com, the delivery company (whom I pressed charges on both drivers for failure to deliver and stealing my groceries) and a different department I was basically told there is nothing they can do for me to get groceries for my family today. I would have to wait 10 days for the refund, they try to expedite, but again no guarantees on when I will receive my refundS. I have 4 children, live paycheck to paycheck and have just dropped $1000 on food. I had received NO FOOD and have no more money. I pleaded for 6 hours while my phone call kept rolling over every 45 minutes to a new person (as if it is on a timer and automatically rolls over.) I basically have no options other than to starve my family until I get a refund. This is no OK in any way shape or form. I did what I was supposed and what walmart directed me to do to rectify it. Yet I had to nickel and dime my friends and family to afford food for my table, I am out now $1500 and am unable to pick up my groceries until after their bedtimes tonight. This is the worst service I have ever heard of. I should receive free groceries and express delivery for all this.

Face of watch just 'popped off' one day and we contacted Allstate (who issued the extended warraties for Walmart on this product. Also use name 'square'?) They send us another watch face and said warranty would continue until end of warranty period. Well, you guess it, on the 2nd watch, the same thing happened. Very frustrating as we'd had to wait weeks for first replacement. When we called today, insurance co said the issue wasn't covered under the warranty. That's strange as it was covered when it happened the first time and this is the same warranty (& hasn't expired). We spend many hours in chat, over the phone, being transferred from person to person, told to go online and file a claim (which wouldn't allow us to write what was really going on with the watch, but forced us into boxes that didn't really apply and then denied claim. Very sneaky the way they set up their claim system). Spoke to 4 different operators, one who told me I was being recorded when I became frustrated when she kept reading/repeating how she really wanted to help me but had to 'check' and I knew she was trying to deny the claim and using different excuses. She transferred me to a 'supervisor' and he also denied claim. I asked for copy of our phone conversation transcript, which he said they couldn't send as they didn't have one, so I requested he email copy of the 'recording' they had said they were making. He refused to send that either, saying their policy was only to send it to an attorney requesting such info. Our purchase was for $204 and I guess they know most people won't get an attorney involved for that amount, but I may. Then I get an email from them saying that with their purchase, if there is a lawsuit, it will be handled by arbitration. What is going on here??? It just made me realize I will never ever again buy anything electronic from Walmart and never obtain any 'extended' warranty or insurance. Neither Walmart, Allstate or that 'square' company (whoever they are) stand behind their products OR they warranties. IF these jokers had stood behind their products and warranties, I would have take that refund and purchased a different watch from them. Because of their lack of honesty, I will never purchase anything from them again and they lost a customer who shopped at their stores all the time. No more!

Thursday morning I get an email that they were delivered on Wednesday evening at 9:30 PM - they weren't.

Also, received a console table from same order which came damaged. Item was returned and I'm waiting for a replacement. Was told it would be here a week ago. When it didn't arrive, I was told to ""be patient"". Under the order status for the item there's been no update for a week. Never would I expect such horrible service from such a huge and established corporation. An experience like investing in new furniture is supposed to be exciting and satisfying and instead it has been an extremely frustrating and time consuming inconvenience.Update: Got home from work Thursday evening (a day after the order was marked as having been delivered) and there was a big pallet of boxes in my driveway blocking my garage. Looked at the  sheet of paper with the order and address that was attached to one of the boxes and it's not my order, not my address, it's not even the right city. Went in and called Walmart and spent another hour and 20 minutes on the phone to schedule a pick up of this stuff and they apparently can't get anyone to pick it up before Monday so it has to sit in my driveway blocking my garage for 4 days.

In contrast, other retailers have offered seamless and efficient cancellation and return processes, often allowing me to initiate a return online or in-store without any hassle.Recommendations:To improve the customer experience, Walmart should implement the following changes:Enhance Order Confirmation: Ensure that order confirmations accurately reflect the selected payment method to prevent incorrect charges.Streamline Order Cancellation: Streamline the order cancellation process to ensure that canceled orders are not mistakenly shipped and charged.Simplify Return Process: Simplify the return process to minimize the time and effort required for customers to return items.Provide Clear Communication: Provide clear and timely communication to customers throughout the order, cancellation, and return processes to keep them informed and minimize confusion.Conclusion:Walmart's confusing payment and return processes have caused me unnecessary inconvenience and frustration. I urge Walmart to take immediate action to address these issues and provide a more customer-friendly experience.Date of experience:November 22, 2023",1

When asked about EverStart contact information, he said he didn’t know. Later I called Walmart Customer Service , but they didn’t have any information. I decided to return battery next day and went to a different Walmart store near my place, I had to take help from someone as I am a senior and can not handle heavy weight of battery. Customer Service at Walmart refused to return the battery (within 24 hours) on the ground they don’t have testing facility. Battery was not tested when I bought it. Despite my repeated request as a senior, they refused to return.I was told to go to another store that has testing facility. The nearest Walmart store with testing facility was about 30 mints drive.

REALLY!?! Then who does? China?I have control over where I spend my money and my time.Issue: I had to essentially beg Walmart for a refund for the returned items.

I have 4 receipts where the scale or computer double billed me. So instead of paying $2.18 for a lb of grapes, I paid double that bc it charged me twice.2. Walmart’s return policy sucks, big time! If the item or box is unopened, but sold for $50.00 or more, they will not give u store credit, if u don’t have the receipt, but ONLY let U exchange the item for the exact same thing.3. Walmart corporate greed = inflation. Their president is paid $24 MILLION a year. U & I pay for that salary with higher prices.4.More Walmart GREED - in a 12 mo. period, ending 7/2023, Walmart made a stunning $152 BILLION in profits, up by 5.5% from the prior year.

Went to chat and it looped me around many times before finally telling me I needed to call Walmart. I call and go thru all this crap about not my house, put on hold for a LONG time; then the person says I need to talk to someone else. So now I have to go thru this all over again. Wanted the whole order cancelled as I now have to go to the store anyway--they refused! All they had to do is look at my house on Google maps and it would be obvious it was not my home.The topper is I cannot even review the driver who misdelivered the order. No wonder he just delivers orders to just any old house. I was charged an almost $8 tip for this crappy service. Walmart website says I saved 9.95 for this crappy service and a pretend amount for around $10 for items I have yet to receive by having this Walmart+ crap--REALLY. I had to get dressed and go to grocery for this great savings and buy the misdelivered item I neede immediately. Don't sign up for Walmart +, for a little more get Amazon Prime and make your life easier, I have very little trouble with them and when I do it is quickly resolved. Amazon Prime videos is much better than Paramount+ which Walmart offers. Amazon Fresh has great sales (you need to hunt for them though) and Prime video now has Thursday night football.Oh found out that they only gave me a partial refund on the misdelivered item. It appears that they used  walmart bucks as part of my refund! I guess this is to try to force people to use walmart if they want toget their money back!

kyla ruck,18reviews,US,2023-11-12T15:57:46.000Z,"$1700 damageIn November of 2022 I had all four of my tires replaced. That Walmart subsequently closed down in the spring of 2023. In September of 2023 as I was driving down the road it felt as if my whole wheel was going to fall off. I took it to a Les Schwab, and they found that my whole wheel was broken, as well as other parts cracked and completely destroyed, one of my lug nuts was off, one of them was broken, and the other two were extremely loose on my passenger side, front wheel. Upon inspection, they determined that when the technician was mounting my wheel, before, making sure the wheel hub was seated to the hub assembly, torqued the wheel down at an angle and in doing so caused the wheel to become damaged as well as the hub assembly and steering knuckle. This resulted in the possibility of my whole wheel falling off as I was driving. They said it was extremely dangerous, and that they could not believe that something worse didn't happen. I have opened a complaint, called and spoken to many people at Walmart, written letters to multiple people and I am getting nowhere. I had to purchase a whole new wheel and other parts costing me $1700 because of the mistake of the Walmart technician. I am at a point where I feel like they think if they ignore me long enough, I will just go away as no one will respond to me. I am very disappointed as I love shopping at Walmart but this experience has been terrible. I have only been asking for them to cover the $1700 that I had to pay out of pocket, I guess sometimes you really do get what you pay for. The tires were a great deal, however, the damage I received as a result was definitely not worth it.Date of experience:September 15, 2023",1

Well they close at 11 pm so needless to say we were trying to hurry and I got careless and after put our things in the car from the buggy I returned our buggy and got in the car drove home! The next day I was looking for my wallet and could not find it anywhere !! We tore our house apart and did not find it. Tore my car inside out looking for it there and still no wallet!! I called Walmart after being transferred 5 different times to customer service I finally had the pleasure of speaking to someone and he was extremely rude before I even spoke a word! I stated that I had lost my wallet and wanted to know if anyone had turned one in and before I finished asking him he rudely interrupted me and said nope and hung up the phone!! I was sick by this time with worry because in my wallet was my debit card , cash , ss card , drivers license ! A couple hours later my grandson says I am gonna Walmart and see if your wallet was turned in . I told him what the guy had told me ! He called them back anyways and at least the lady was nice and told him no nothing was turned in ! During this time my cousin and her daughter had came in and was helping us look again in the house in the car! Her daughter said have you tried calling Walmart to see if anyone turned it in ? I just busted out laughing! She came outside and said ummm found your wallet they have it at Walmart it was turned in right before closing which was right after I had left someone found it ! So they lied to me probably because he was too lazy to look any farther than his legs would let him because it required him to move! So why did they lie to my grandson again probably for the same reason! I know one thing I hope and pray that me , you or anyone on this earth ever need CPR by a Walmart employee or need them to dial 911 because it ain’t happening from one them !

This is a gift for a baby shower. The crib supposedly was delivered but my son never got it.  Walmart said that the freight company had to resolve the issue. The freight company said that they have a signed slip, but they refused to send us a copy because we are not their direct customer. They said that Walmart is the vendor, and they have to resolve it. Walmart put their foot down and did not do anything. This item was over $500 and now we are at the mercy of the credit card company. This would have never happened with Amazon.

Today I went in to purchase only twenty $20 gift cards (totaling less than their $600 normal & $1000 holiday maximum gift card purchase rules) and was turned away and essentially called a liar when I stated I purchase them often and its for a business.

I have never been treated so poorly by staff in my life. I understand there being certain rules in effect to prevent fraud, however showing proof its for a legitimate business has never been an issue while purchasing (as you can see in the attached receipts totaling thousands of dollars of previously purchased gift cards). Now we are going to have to do all of our gift card purchasing at a Fred Meyer further away in order to avoid this problem.

And taxes on $200 is another 20 bucks. Even though in Colorado you are Not suppose to charge taxes on food!I never got that when I waited tables at $2.10hr but I did get stuck paying a percentage of that in required taxes on the customers bill.Anyway so to get almost $300 worth of food it costs me $50.

Finally the order goes through.I have a look at my orders a few hours later and it is all cancelled with this error message ""We're sorry, we had to cancel some items due to unusual account activity. It may take up to 10 business days for the bank to remove payment authorization.""I called the support team and it took a lot of yelling at the phone to get a human. When I did they apologized after I explained the problem. I really want Walmart to survive and that is why I do use them once and while to give Amazon some competition. They need to resolve their phone support and fix their security.I will order tomorrow and see if it lets me.Date of experience:October 11, 2023",3

I was in the store shopping and decided to check and ask about my new lens. I handed my old frames and then sat while the ""Optician"" began to try and place the lens in the old frame. About 10 minutes later, he came out and said, ""there is a hairline crack in your frame."" The newly discovered crack was accompanied by an unmentioned bubble The ""Optician"" offered to shave the frame so it could fit. Wouldn't that affect the lens placement of what is highly measured for my eyes? I said no!  I have a three/four week old picture of me wearing the frame. There is no evidence of a crack of bubble.  Conclusion: the lens were made too big for the measured frame, and they applied too much heat AND pressure to jam the new lenses in the two year old frame!I waited 35 minutes for the manager to return from lunch. He, as well,  tried to insert the lenses in the frame. The manager tried the same technique saying, ""I can shave it to fit,"" ultimately breaking the frame. They did refund for my lenses (lenses alone = $380+). They did not offer to replace my frame that they broke in two pieces, using their ""policy"" as an excuse- stated afterwards, something not mentioned before I agreed to lenses only.Bottom Line: The lens were made too big for the measured frame, and the two ""Opticians"" applied too much heat and pressure to jam the new lenses in the two year old frame, breaking them and trying to get out of it with a never mentioned policy!  I called WalMart main number and no now has called to propose any solution to this issue (like Refund me for the broken frames!), telling me that they would get back to me in 3 days!Date of experience:October 04, 2023",1

When I called them their records showed they split the credit into 4 smaller amounts. And even totaling those 4, came to only $125. So even IF the credits came thru to my credit card account, they still would have been $10 short. The bank underwriter of my credit account told me on 3 different occasions that they NEVER received any credits!!!! 😤😡🤬.I dislike Walmart immensely. They are rip-offs!!

I pressed the button 3x over the span of that time with no response.  Mind you - my 82 yo mother was with me and she can’t stand for very long and we had already done most of our shopping.-A rep walking by directed me to a gentleman named **** in electronics.  He was busy with another customer but offered to assist.-He admitted to not knowing how to help but would try.  The regular person apparently was at lunch.  I helped him the best I could and we measured 4.25 yards of heavy plastic.-*****could not print out a slip for the register but told me to tell customer service how much and they would assist.-I went to customer service and they said I would have to return to the back to have it measured and disputed what I had been told (making me very angry by this point) and I asked for a manager-After a few min, they directed me to the back to a manager.  I insisted that I don’t know who I’m looking and in my mind, I don’t want to waste any more of my time.-So a female rep attempted to “snatch” the plastic roll from me and I resisted, saying I can carry it back.-Her response was that it’s Walmart property (as if I’m a thief - if I were we wouldn’t be here) and until I pay for it, she will handle in a very disrespectful, demeaning and accusatory tone - in front of everyone near the customer service counter.-On the walk to the back of the store, this rep said something that set me off and I asked her “who the hell do you think you’re talking to”-This store rep yelled at me and said “I’m talking to you b***” and said something about you’re not going to talk to me like I’m a child.  I said something like oh really and she said “yea, I’ll say it again b***” and a few f****s flew out of her mouth.This all took place on the floor with other Walmart reps hearing it and other customers, staring in disbelief.At the end of the day, Walmart reps have no business engaging in that kind of behavior with its reps.  I tried my best to resolve this at Customer Service and Customer Service passed the buck.-Once we got in the back of the store, she took the plastic to the sewing area and left it without showing me who the manager was and with no direction.  She just walked off.-I finally connected with the manager who measured the plastic at 4.5 yards and rang me out   But still not satisfied, I called the store (since the in-store reps) allowed her behavior and didn’t check it or apologize to me.  I was placed on a long hold.  Someone finally answered and put me back on hold to only end the call.So I checked out and left the store.I am highly pissed off and expect a response from Walmart in a timely fashion, since no one in the store wanted to dealt with it and to send feedback via walmart.com is limited to 1000 characters.Date of experience:October 08, 2023",1

At one time I was very happy with their service, this is when a tall African-American was in charge.  He would call me, himself if he had a question or concern with my medication, he was always very attentive.  Lately, you have clerks that don't even look up to see who is there, they hide behind the counter.  The only one that gives excellent service is JOSE, he is always there with a smile, very friendly and excellent customer service, not like everybody else.  Well, my problem was that I had a medication that is a ""controlled substance, so I can only get it every 30 days, which is no problem.  My problem was that I went to the doctor on the 28th of Sept, asked for my prescription, their called/fax/email that same day.  I didn't get it till the 3rd of Oct.  This medication causes withdrawal symptoms after the 2nd day.  If there was a problem, why didn't they call. No, they sat on it until I started to look into it.  These withdrawal symptoms cause a lot of problems and major problems.  These people that you have behind the counter, do care.

A.F.,1review,US,2023-10-07T17:20:50.000Z,"Customer bewareI am appalled and offended by this company. My online account was deactivated without warning or justification. I‘d been a dedicated Walmart+ member for awhile and that should count for a whole lot more than such callous disregard and mistreatment. And to do so because of their own employees (shoppers/drivers) mistakes…they punish valued customers just to try to appear innocent. I do not call customer service to complain; I do so only when forced to. If you hire shoppers/drivers who don’t put in the effort or care to conduct their job descriptions appropriately and effectively, how is that my fault? I gave of my time and money and I’m the one that gets reprimanded for reporting their errors? Like when I’m missing half my order, or when random substitutions are made without notification even though the original item says “shopped”, or when the order experiences multiple delays, or when the driver delivers my order someplace I don’t even recognize because the attached photo does not remotely resemble the interior of my apartment building, etc. Plus it’s interesting that they choose this form of attack after I’m issued multiple credits (in itself, an admission of culpability) to use towards future purchases that I can’t now make; so that saves their “bottom line” if they don’t have to literally pay for their mistakes. It also occurred right after I was issued a refund for “unusual activity” on THEIR end. I never asked to cancel my subscription. I never asked to be inconvenienced or blamed for the actions of others— Walmart needs to take responsibility for their own instead of blaming someone who’s given a proven profitable history with their company. By the way, I never write reviews. Ever. But until I receive a justified apology for my grievances, I plan on making it my mission to call them out by reporting this misconduct and warning others: shop somewhere else. Literally anywhere that treats you like a respected human being of consumerism. Or simply a human being.Date of experience:October 06, 2023",1

One of the items in my order was a bottle of Great Value bleach.  My husband brought the bags in from the trunk of my car into our kitchen.  We noticed a trail of wet spots on the floor and upon closer inspection saw that the bottle of bleach had a small whole in it.  Bleach had leaked from the bottle into the bag and onto the floor and on two area rugs.  Both rugs are ruined.  I called customer service and they transferred me 3 times and I was on hold for a representative for over 25 minutes. I was told all they could do for me was refund me for the bottle of bleach I purchased, but I would first need to return the bottle to the store.  I submitted pictures and offered to send them my damaged rugs to be considered for compensation and I was told that they do not compensate for damages and all they could offer me is a $2 refund for the bleach.

I have called Walmart SEVERAL times over the last month to explain the card is no longer active.

I asked Wal Mart if they could please have my packages sent UPS--USPS--or Fed Ex as they have no issues finding my address.

I wasn't sure at that point if I was doing something wrong when ordering so I wasn't sure and asked the employee if they would keep my account open. After repeated phone calls and being put on hold to try and recover my account I was told that I would be getting my account back and would be getting an email within the next hour.

Since March-2023 I am doing 90% of my daily purchase from Walmart(store /online) only.On 28-Aug-2023, I purchased two mattresses with the same brand and after using it I realized the quality is not appropriate and my family are facing medical issues. After that I called Customer care on 20th-Sep-2023 and the customer care agent suggested me to return the Mattress immediately to Walmart and he raised the return request for both mattresses. Since both Mattress are big in size so, I requested to agent it difficult for me to return mattress in store, then agent told me don’t worry and I will escalate this issue to other team and they will change the return request to home pickup with-in 48 Hour and but it not changed.After 48 Hour, I again called customer care and he said he is not getting the option to change it to home pickup and again raised the return request for the same item and told me to wait for another 24 hour, but again it did not change.With-in 4-5 days whenever I called the customer care for this issue they always gave me assurance with new timelines and raised the return request for the same item.Since I am new in the US and using Walmart from the day-one of my purchase in the US and not aware of the return policy(Max number of return requests with-in any timeframe) and also not aware that Walmart agents are preparing a ground for policy violation for me.On Sep-24, I received notification - my account as well as paid Walmart+ membership is deactivated due to return policy violation.Again, I called the customer care and explain the reason for high volume of return issue then agent told me there are no issue on my end, since due to multiple return request for same item- system raised the red flag and deactivated my account for safety purpose and told me don’t worry I will escalate this issue to account review team and your account will be activate with-in 48 Hour and he created  the incident for me.From last one week I got assurances only. But yesterday (29-Sep) when I called customer care, they told me now they are getting the response from the review team and they are not going to activate my account due to the high volume of return requests.Review team response:-There are no issues in return and refund from customers. Due to the high volume of return requests don’t activate the customer account, but customers can do the store purchase.Since I had good faith on Walmart , I have ordered two new mattresses of different brands during this timeframe, and now I have four mattresses in my house. Today 30-Sep I called the escalation team in morning and they told me I can return my defective mattress to store as they have all my details but after reaching store they denied to accept the return as they don’t have any details. I don’t know to whom I will trust on Walmart and all lines are secured and recorded mode. I am waiting for supervisor call but no one trying to reach me.Few observation here:-1. I have received 3 More items after deactivating my account (Two new Mattress and one Heating pad) and Walmart treating these items as a part of high volume of return requests. This is surprising for me.2. Higher team not trying to understand route cause of the issue.3. They are not giving the exact reason for the deactivation of my account over email.4. I spent more than 10 Hour on this issue with the agent and it’s really painful.5. I clearly asked for my violation reason and what I did wrong, but every time they are talking about the high volume of return requests but not accepting their agent issue for this. It Looks like we purchased the item but there are restrictions on return if there is a quality issue.6. Since my account is deactivated , I am not able to return the Mattress on store , now I have 4 mattresses in my home.7.

Not sure how this store can operate. They have one central customer service area that handle all customer concerns from product returns, to price adjustments and online orders.  You wait forever to get served then it takes another call to the warehouse to bring the item out of stock and that took process took another 20 minutes. Spoke with a Manager who agreed that the store’s customer service area is not well setup to handle online order pickup.  Be prepared to wait.

Meanwhile we are out $1000, and have little recourse than to hire an attorney? for a refund. Now an hour later to add insult to injury, we are told it was delivered at 9:30 am, while I was outside waiting for any sign of a delivery truck, and possibly delivered a camouflaged full sized refrigerator designed to look like a tree? Its probably hiding out there in my garden somewhere inconspicuous. I'll go back out with my flashlight and hope I don't trip over it. My advice with Walmart, if it needs delivering, it's best to take a week off work, calling both Walmart and their delivery professionals every 10 minutes, since nobody at Walmart follows up on anything for their customers.Date of experience:September 01, 2023",1

UNAMERICAN!! ABSOLUTE MALARCKY!!!Moving is ranked among the top of all stressors that exist, including divorce and grief over a death, and here I am trying to move and my entire move’s interrupted, delayed, and stymied by not receiving the things I need, or having them arrive broken, etc., and then, being abused like in some sort of third-world dictatorship by the company from whom I bought the needed items (furniture, etc.).If somebody orders 10 things from you, and you deliver half of them late, broken-in-transit, or defective, and you mistreat that customer when they call to get redress for those items - causing them to have to make multiple calls to the most ridiculous, unfathomable degree, and be hung up on, disconnected, and gaslighted - and then, when they persist in expecting PROPER redress, you punish them for complaining too much, and cancel their account - rendering them unable to return any other items, including even the ones that are currently still in transit if they turn out to be defective or damaged as so many other items have been, ￼then that is a complete, disgusting, abusive breach of everything that the free market stands for. ￼￼May the free market due to Walmart what the free market does to businesses like Walmart – that is, if we actually still have anything like an actual free market anymore.

For what, so they can steal that one too? This is a brand new biazzre thing, normally they just replace the funds. Something isn't right about this. Oh well. Lesson Learned. Less shopping on walmart.com from now on and making double sure I used paypal so they can't get away with stealing my money. Either way I am reporting then to the DOJ and FTC for fraud and theft.    Made a purchase with my gift card and then later was issued a refund but not before Walmart just stole my gift card right out of my account so I cannot use my gift card. They used to just make things right and issue the money they know they owe people. This time they told me they ""escalated it to the giftcard department."" This means I will never see the money.

Nathaniel,2reviews,US,2023-09-13T17:08:29.000Z,"Walmart +: Inconsistent Delivery and Inventory ManagementAs an avid online shopper and a customer of both Walmart + and Amazon Prime, I am disappointed to say that Walmart + falls short in comparison due to inconsistent delivery experiences and inventory management issues.One significant issue is the frequent discrepancy between the ""delivered"" notification email received from Walmart + and the actual delivery of the order. Countless occasions have left me frustrated when an email claims my package has arrived, only to find it missing from my doorstep. This inconsistency not only wastes valuable time and creates inconvenience, but also undermines the trust I have in Walmart + as a reliable delivery service.Even when orders do reach my doorstep, it is disheartening to discover that items are frequently missing from my packages. I understand that mistakes can happen, but this recurring issue indicates a deeper problem with Walmart +'s quality control and employee accountability. It is crucial for Walmart to address this issue promptly and ensure that their employees, specifically the drivers, are trustworthy and reliable.Moreover, another frustrating issue I have encountered is the inconsistency between online inventory availability and in-store stock. Often, when attempting to order an item online, I am greeted with an unavailability message. However, when I visit the physical store on the same day, I find an abundance of the exact item I was told was not available online. This leads me to question the dedication and work ethic of the associates responsible for maintaining accurate online inventory information. If Walmart wants to compete with giants like Amazon Prime, they need to address this discrepancy and ensure their associates are proactive and committed to delivering a seamless shopping experience.To truly compete with the likes of Amazon Prime, Walmart + needs to take drastic action. They must prioritize reliable and trustworthy drivers for package deliveries, enhance internal quality control processes, and ensure that employees responsible for maintaining online inventory accurately reflect the stock available in stores. Additionally, improved communication with customers regarding delivery updates and resolution of issues is essential to retain customer trust.Until these significant issues are effectively addressed, it is difficult for me to recommend Walmart + as a reliable alternative to Amazon Prime. Walmart has the potential to deliver a seamless online shopping experience, but they need to take immediate and drastic action to rectify their current shortcomings.Date of experience:September 11, 2023",1

Kristin,2reviews,US,2023-09-13T04:17:50.000Z,"Checking receipts at the door? Lost me as a customer!I live in a rural town in Texas. It's a low crime area (not crime free...no place is...but low crime). Our local Walmart decided that they are going to ""check receipts"" as you leave the store. This is a horrible trend, of a low trust society and I will not go back to shop there if I have to ""clear my good name"" as I exit the store with goods I just paid for. Yes, I know you can legally refuse to produce a receipt, but they can also ban you from returning if you are combative or refuse to comply with this request. In short, this is not a business where I want to spend my working dollar. I get the strong impression they are offsetting losses in major cities like Dallas and on the West Coast, which have rampant theft, by closely scrutinizing shoppers in other areas of the country. Shame on you, Wal-Mart. Without my weekly shopping, you just lost $8,000/year in sales revenue. Imagine if 10 more people in town quit shopping there - it adds up to big money very quickly! Note: I will return to shop there again ONLY if this policy is permanently done away with...but I am told they are actually planning to double down with new handheld scanners by the exit door. Well....bye.Date of experience:September 09, 2023",1

Bradford Lee,5reviews,US,2023-09-12T03:32:47.000Z,"The Nightmare That is Walmart!I've been Vita Coco from Walmart for a while now and always the taste was a bit strange to me. Didn't seem like coconut too much. I just thought it was supposed to be that way because I'd never gotten it from any other place. So because of Walmart's $35 order min policy( which is insane considering I'm a + member.)  I ordered it from Amazon, because this and a couple more items was all I needed. Well, I noticed right away that Amazon's tasted more fresh and more like actual coconut. I finished the case and they were all quite tasty. However, I needed some more in a hurry and ordered 2 cartons in a delivery order from Wamart. I was in a pinch because I needed them ASAP, as they really help with a very distressing health prob I currently have. The order was delivered covered in some black stuff. I had to clean off just about every item. Even the eggs. It's like the opened the cartoon and smeared it on them. So it makes me think it was done on purpose. I let that slide, but told CS. They claimed they reported The incident. Today, I found that one of the cartons of Vita Coco was leaking around the plastic spout of the bottle. I reported it and the bot said to return it. Gas is about $5/ gal and the Vita Coco is 2.04. Needless to say I cancelled the return request. Funny how Amazon can deliver a WHOLE CASE without any damage, but Walmart can't even deliver 2 little carton with out damage... or them being dirty! I will be ordering from Amazon from now on and I will make sure to order enough cases that I don't run out. More and more I find that I loathe Walmart with a passion. I'd planned to cancel my + membership, however I have an elderly sick parent that I can't leave to go shopping so they have my up the creek w/out a  paddle Just about. I have started ordering everything I can from  Amazon, but because I live in a small town with no other options I have to order most groceries from Walmart.Now prior to this I filed a complaint against Walmart and we had a major standoff, so I'm sure they have flagged my acct. So it's no wonder I get dry cold customer service from the reps. Oh they are nice... but it's like okay lady, got your complaint anddddd moving right along. So I might as well not even complain when something's messed up. This last order was paid for with a gift card, but in future I will use a card so I can partially dispute the charge for items that are messed up... Or the total charge if the whole order is messed up. Yes, you can do a partial dispute folks! So I suggest people start taking advantage of this. Maybe this will make Walmart sit up and take notice. It's a shame how a company that used to be pretty good, in most cases, has gone to the dogs! I remember I used to spend hours in Walmart, now I don't dare set foot in there because of their reputation for falsely accusing people of theft. Word to the wise, the scan an go is a setup waiting to happen. You scan and pay and expect to leave and be about your business, only they find some way to accuse you of steeling. I also don't like the fact their self checkout is set up to cheat you and the registers are arranged in a corralled circle in most place. Like they are trying to fence you in. Something should be done about that because it's a safety issue. More and more people or going in places and opening fire. If this were done in Walmart all the people in the corral are dead ducks! It'd be like shooting fish in a barrel. If there were any other store that delivered groceries in my town I'd be on it like white one rice! I'm so sick of having problems with just about every order.Date of experience:September 09, 2023",1

My order, which was supposed to arrive promptly, was inexplicably delayed by a whole week without any prior notification or explanation. This delay was inconvenient, to say the least, as I had specifically chosen Walmart + for its speedy delivery.The real frustration began when the promised delivery date arrived, and my order was nowhere to be seen. I diligently checked the Walmart website for tracking information, but there were no updates regarding the delivery status. This absence of delivery proof on the website left me baffled and irritated.In my attempt to seek assistance and clarification, I engaged in a live chat session with a customer service agent named Tesha and Rogelio. Regrettably, this interaction added to my dissatisfaction. Tesha seemed unresponsive to my concerns, offered vague and unhelpful responses, and abruptly terminated the chat session without adequately addressing my issue or allowing me to continue seeking assistance. It was a frustrating experience, as it felt like my concerns were being dismissed.As a long-time Walmart customer, I had expected a higher level of service and accountability. This entire ordeal not only inconvenienced me but also undermined my trust in Walmart's commitment to customer satisfaction.In conclusion, I sincerely hope that Walmart takes this feedback to heart and takes steps to enhance its services. I am looking for a resolution to the problems I encountered, as well as a review of the conduct of customer service agents to prevent similar situations in the future. My trust in Walmart has been shaken, and I hope that efforts will be made to restore it.Date of experience:September 04, 2023",1

Anonymous,1review,US,2023-09-03T02:18:36.000Z,"BUYER BEWAREBUYER BEWARE! I bought a tv stand from Walmart online and went through h-e-l-l. While the tv stand is relatively nice looking for the price it isn’t worth the hassle. The tv stand arrived without any instructions. Also, a key component was missing. Walmart customer care is a joke. Most of the reps just transfer you to another rep to hear the same bs rebuttal “return the item for a refund”. They absolutely don’t care about any issues that arise. They don’t care about the time and energy I have spent dealing with them and the issues. I have spent two days back and forth trying to get help. After over five hours of being transferred back and forth between agents while trying to multitask on my day off I was finally able to get an account rep that actually did her job. She found an app to download the exact assembly instructions. Great! Now to get this thing done. Upon reviewing the online instruction pamphlet I realized a middle support leg was missing. Back to dealing with “customer care” and the only option was to return the item. I’m a busy single mom and I don’t have time to wait around for Fed Ex to pick it up. I also don’t have the necessary strength or energy to haul this item solo back to a Walmart nor do I know anyone willing to help. I decided to go ahead and keep the tv stand as I could easily get a piece of wood to replace the missing leg. I’ve assembled furniture solo for years. Moving forward assembly was mostly a breeze just screw this, cam lock that, etc. Then sadly when I was almost finished an issue arose with one of the handles to a door. The hardware seemed to be defective. The first two doors assembled with ease. Again, plain and simple just align holes then screw this into that. For some reason the third door handle wouldn’t come together. I took out the screws and tried again. This time the top portion of the handle screwed together but the bottom portion wouldn’t screw in any further nor would it loosen. I got a male neighbor to try to resolve this and he couldn’t loosen it up neither. We tried everything you can think up except cutting the screws and defective metal pieces. Once again called Walmart customer care. Back and forth bs to be told “return item for a refund”. One rep even had the audacity to tell me to “add oil to get it loose, put a rubber band or duct tape for grip or return it”. That is it. Lastly, the doors don’t align whatsoever. Sometimes in life you really do get what you pay for. While I can get a refund by returning the item I cannot get back any of my time, energy, and effort in dealing with this. Let’s not mention how I will need to spend more of my time and energy to disassemble the item and find a way to return it or  lose income because of having to take off of work to wait for Fed Ex to pick it up! To say I’m furious about this would be an understatement. Just shop elsewhere. Don’t say you weren’t warned!Date of experience:September 01, 2023",1
Donna Rehman,3reviews,US,2023-09-17T14:55:15.000Z,"non returnable items not clearly indicated on websiteJust guessing- but the reason there are so many 1 star reviews here may be because others were 'opted out' of reviewing on WalMart.com, as I was...?  I tried to leave a 3 star review for this experience buying Binax Covid tests:  Good product.  Product is FIVE STARS, online shopping experience is ONE STAR.  Online order Sunday 8/27/23 with Store pickup on Monday 8/28/23 around 2pm. I am reviewing to caution other online shoppers to ALWAYS scroll down before adding ANY item to their WalMart cart because the NOTICE if something is not returnable isn't visible unless you do.  I picked up my order on the way out of town, and only later saw that the expiration dates were all close enough that I NEVER would have purchased the same amount of tests had I been shopping in-store.  So I clicked 'start a return' on my receipt and only then found out I had purchased something non-refundable.  I immediately tried to look at the item on the site to learn how I could have missed this, and the item was no longer online.  Very aggravating, and doesn't inspire trust in WalMart.  The customer service person emailing me about this (called a 'coach' for some reason) mentioned where the 'non-returnable' notice was, so last night (9/1/23) I went back to the website to check.  Surprise, the Binax tests are posted again!  So I walked through putting one in my cart without ordering.  It's possible to add one to your cart, get a confirmation page re: that, and go to your cart to checkout without EVER SEEING the notice- if you don't scroll down.  If you're familiar with a product as I was with this test, you have no need to scroll down.  (screenshots available).  The notice is in small print and is seriously less than obvious.  I consider this an expensive lesson in online shopping (most of these will likely go unused), and will avoid WalMart as much as possible in the future.Date of experience:August 26, 2023",1

Her manager's name listed on my receipt is Mr. RESLEY.

Which is arthritis in the spine and also diagnosed with 25-50% forward slippage of the spine. That was back in 2013. As you can imagine it progressed in the last 10 year’s to so much more and worse. Extremely unbearable at times, but always pain any given time of day/night. So here’s my complaint. Because of the medication I’ve been legally prescribed by a Real Doctor and not a “Pill Mill”. Which is a narcotic. And my doctor and I have tried many other medications and he’s outsourced me to free clinics because of my physical health and the medication. With plenty of proof from several different specialists and many different treatments I/We’ve tried. It all comes back to the medication.Walmart decided to cut me off, because the DEA is on everyone, Because a pharmacy wasn’t legit and pressure is on! I understand that 100%! I’ve offered every medical record from 2013. Because i understand how unfortunately people use it in a different way. Apparently that wasn’t good enough for Walmart.So they cut me off. When they called my Doctors office asking why I live here in Titusville and my Doctor is in Kissimmee. I again can prove why… Because I used to live there, and had a business there. So he became our family doctor. It’s about ab hour ride. Ok…. I’ve told the pharmacist numerous times why… He calls the doctors office and asked them why??? How are the office girls (who are new) supposed to know why I still see him when I live here. Maybe because he’s our family doctor. And i have family I visit when I gi that way. Well anyway. Because of the medication and the people abusing it, I went without my medicine for 3 weeks! And had to find a pharmacy to except me at this very difficult time in life! So thanks to all the people out there abusing it, and thanks to Walmart Pharmacy in Titusville Florida. There are people that really need it. Shame on you for judging me!!!!!

I had someone years ago run up my card and then tried to push a payment through (thankfully it was declined), so they could ring up more items. Now today, I had a pickup order added to my account in a completely different state. I was able to cancel it before it was picked up. These are two different accounts (I no longer have a card through them), but both issues originated in Houston, TX! Yes, they have a call center there and obviously they can access your account!

We were trying to spread his purchases and have some with an in-store return policy in case of issues (he kept the one he already received and put together from a 3rd party seller on Amazon - 6 days later, no Prime!). We also don't like giving ALL online purchases to Amazon (but.....). He is furnishing an apartment, there is no fraud, he has a VERY valid credit card and an excellent credit rating (I teach him well!). I've read this isn't just us. Do these online retailers just want to lose to Amazon? Stupid!I won't EVER shop online with Walmart again! Their website is immensely confusing, you get your order in all sorts of ways (delivered, pick up in store, 2 day delivery) and you have no choice on many things. Just such a pain in a**!You HAVE to do curbside pickup at the Supercenter at Baseline/CC in Mesa AZ, so if you forgot something or want to pick up something for say dinner that night, you need to do that, park, and then go in the store. Who wants to do that?Also, we live in hot AZ!  Who feels like wasting gas and sitting idling when it is that hot? You're at least 5-10 minutes waiting, on a good day!  NO WAY I would EVER do that during the holidays!Don't the powers-that-be want everyone, including companies, to cut down on gas usage? Walmart did NOT get the memo and should be more in tune with the wastefulness. It isn't just a customer or 2, there's spaces and spaces.These companies need to get a grip if they have a prayer on competing against Amazon!

Whose bright idea was it, to do a remodel and not close the doors to store until all employees and maps provided to where the products have been moved to? Selfishness, incompetence, no respect to your customers or employees, not to mention the disregard to the disabled consumer! I live in Concord, NC. On August 1st I attempted to get my food NEEDS and had to cancell the order at the self check out due to the NEW REGISTERS, not able to retrieve the receipt on the register to find a conflict or concerns of a none payment of HEALTHY BENEFIT. I am a senior citizen and disable, having considerable pain due to the extra effort to find the restricted diet needs which are no longer in prior areas in store due to remodel. Plus I paid gas money(I do not drive due to disability). So all my effort, 3 hours is shopping wasted, No groceries and gas of 10.00 lost! On August 2nd, I paid 20.00 of gas to my neighbor to reshop, at same Walmart 1027, I brought my experience to the attention of a manager with no resolve. After  3 hours of shopping (which should only take 11/2 hours ) I went back to self check out again washing the register with my own Lysol wipe , and get to my veggies for weights and the NEW REGISTER SCALE NOT WORKING!!!The confusion and frustration and exhaustion of redoing this process from the day before was incredibly concerning. Walmart employee did not listen to me as they were touching my purchases to move me to another registers. No one was listening which escalated to a total melt down on my behalf where I said ( F) you to all of Walmart! Again ordered cancelled my efforts were all for not.I am disgusted with Walmart all of this could have been avoided if there was some forethought on Walmarts behalf in their remodeling effort. Maps provided? Working registers? What a concept? I think I should be compensated for my time and refund for my gas of 30.00 over to 2 days of shopping and both days order was cancelled. I am not well and take great efforts in shopping and disinfecting the the products, the carts, and the area I cash out in. Covid is still an issue, and the lackadaisical attitude toward a Killer, is not understood by me.

Then someone left my package outside my apartment door many days later,and thankfully I did get many justified refunds.I have repeatedly complained to all of these stores and delivery carriers about this too.On the review sites,Pissed Consumer,Site Jabber,Hissingkitty,UPS,FedEx,USPS,and Walmart have only 1 star ratings and 1000's of customer complaint bad reviews.Sometimes I got really lucky and a nice neighbor or maybe another delivery person with these services leaves my package outside my door many days or even a week after I never received it when the carriers and stores I bought them from said they were delivered to me.Recently 3 days in a row FedEx kept saying on their site,(and Walmart also kept saying it was on the way each of these days,) that they were going to deliver my $40 dress I ordered from Walmart.com between 10 in the morning to around 3 in the afternoon,then that changed and FedEX claimed that it was going to be delivered by the end of each day,but then later in the evening of each of these days it changed to delayed and still pending.I even spoke with a FedEx customer service agent the second day on that Saturday and he claimed they had too many packages the day before and he reassured me that my package would be delivered by the end of the day,well it wasn't delivered on Sunday either!And the dress was now out of stock too, it was finally delivered on Monday July 31.I had placed another recent order of 6 items they claimed they delivered to me about a week before  but I never received them and in the picture the delivery guy took, you couldn't even see what building it was and there was no package in the picture,and the picture was taken from too much of a distance.I called and told this to a customer service representative and he said yeah you can't see what building it is and there isn't any package in the picture either,so he gave me a refund and I had to re-order these un delivered items,and then it was delayed for 7 days and it still was saying delayed on Walmart's site even after this.I spoke with a nice customer service representative about this bad situation with Fedex repeatedly delaying my dress,and he said that they have often complained about these FedEx delivery guys and he said but why would your order from our store be delayed like this? He then said they often don't have delivery drivers show up to do their job, I said yes they don't have enough good help.He gave me a refund for the 6 items,and he said he also gave me a refund for the dress but whenever I got refunds it always showed this on their site but it didn't this time for some reason.A day later when I called about these delayed orders again, a nice customer service representative offered twice to give me a discount promocode but I said no because I was unfairly falsely accused in the past of often trying to get compensation and promocodes (which they definitely totally owed me) when I didn't ask for them I only rightly complained and spoke up about the bad service experiences I had and most of the time they gave me a justified refund.On July 31, I ordered 3 packages of sugar free cookies and 2 minutes later the site said my items were canceled falsely accusing me after carefully reviewing my account of a series of return violations and said while future orders from this account will also be canceled I'm always welcome to shop in store. I don't drive and I have a bad back condition so I can't carry,or lift heavy things.Date of experience:July 29, 2023",1

I ordered a rug set for my best friend, who was working on his home. On April 17, 2023, I placed the order in his name so he would be sure to receive it. The package arrived on April 21, 2023 and I realized right away that the color of the rug was not going to work in the room.My friend took the rug back to his local Walmart only to be told that they do NOT take return orders from Walmart.com back as a service to their customers. My friend was informed that he would need to contact Walmart's customer service to contact the 3rd party vendor, who will then contact him. My best friend relayed this information to me since I placed the order and had the information. I emailed Walmart.com on April 24, 2023 at 2:46 pm asking to return the rugs and received my first notice that Overstock.com had been notified that I wanted to return my order.On April 27, 2023 I placed my second request with Walmart.com, where I received the original response in return. Walmart.com did not take the time to send a second request, follow up, or find out why no one from Overstock.com had not taken the time to respond to my request. Out of frustration, I reached out again to Walmart.com on April 28, 2023. I received an updated response that stated Walmart .com had reached out to Overstock.com again on my behalf about this order.By this time, I found the perfect rug for my best friend.  The rug was installed and looked great in his newly renovated bathroom. I made a person-to-person plea with Overstock.com and called in to speak with a customer service agent. After ten minutes on hold, I was exhausted with the whole process.On May 28, I received this email addressed to my best friend from Overstock.comRE: Message from Walmart.com Customer: Initiate a return, 200010941719494[ref:_00D112L1Qo._500Dp11Wg:ref]Hello XXXXX,Thank you for contacting Overstock regarding a return for your Traditional Plush Basin BlueWashable Nylon Bathroom Rug Runner Option: 3 Piece Set.

The device was defective upon receipt, would not charge, would not power up; warranty had started February 1, 2023, I ordered and received my device in late June 2023, warranty expired Jan 31 2024.   5 months of the warranty had expired before i received my device.   A new device should have been provided with a full 1 year warranty.    Return terms received with the device were different from what was published on the website.   This company also does business as Deal Road on the Walmart.com online platform.Red Tag Sales was reluctant to address the issues with the device.   Finally we agreed that they would provide a replacement device with a full 1 year warranty.    The warranty on the replacement device also started on 1 Feb 2023 and expired 31 Jan 2024.   The device was returned.Over 20 emails were exchanged with Red Tag Sales on this matter.   Walmart did little and Walmart still holds the key to final credit for the returned device.  Walmart has held the refund for 7 full business days without completing the transaction that provides a credit to my account.Just to be clear, the 1st device was defective and replaced.   Neither the initial or replacement device were provided with full one year warranty that would normally accompany a new device.  Vendor return terms and conditions  received with the device were different than posted on the Walmart website.     Walmart has held my card card refund beyond the 7 business day period.   Red Tag Sales has delayed the return process associated with this sale.Walmart freezes out customer reviews quickly after a sale is complete.   If Walmart allowed a review to be posted I would do so there as well.Given my current experience with Red Tag Sales/Deal Road AND Walmart I wouldn't waste any time with either of these companies.Date of experience:July 30, 2023",1

If you all want to stop receiving the same crappy shopping experiences you all posted here about, shop literally anywhere else but Walmart, until they make the most basic of improvements so that we no longer have to vent in frustration on these review sites.The sheer eff you attitude their customer service department has for its customers is absolutely appalling and nothing is going to change that until and only until they start hurting in their pockets. Spend the couple extra cents and buy your items at the thousands of other choices we have other than this scandalous, racist, homophobic conglomerate, that we have fed countless billions to, only to be treated like the stepchild junkie in the family when all we’re asking for is the most basic of common courtesies.Date of experience:July 28, 2023",1

Derby Farm,2reviews,US,2023-07-29T16:02:25.000Z,"La PlataLa Plata, MD USA Walmart. Checkout person repeatedly rings up wrong prices and/or wrong number of items.  Is there now an incentive for them to intentionally overcharge the customer?  When I stopped her to tell her she was wrong, she said ""oops"" and corrected. First item was a wrong price and next item was how many of an item I purchased.  I could not constantly monitor her actions and unload my cart, so I checked my receipt when I got home.  She charged me for 13 items when I bought 10.  She also charged me for 4 of another item when I bought three.The worst part is calling the store on the phone.  It rings and rings and finally automatically hangs up. I tried any department and they, too, immediately hang up when I begin to talk. Kinda easy to figure that out.I called Walmart's main numbers only to get a prerecorded message that totally makes no sense, or a robot that could care less about me.  I signed up for a call-back feature. A robot called me back twice at the same time and thus a three second delay (that means they speak the same script at the same time with a three second delay).  And surprise, it hangs up.It must be that they all know they are untouchable.  That obviously includes corporate as they successfully accept their communications ineptitude and further build walls between the consumer and their human staff.So now I must drive back to the store and argue with the attitude-laden person at the RETURN desk.  The last time that happened, I told the clerk that typically a ""sorry"" could be offered since I had to drive back to the store because of their error. She said ""I aint sayin sorry for no one."" followed by an expletive out of her own mouth.  That says it all in my book.Keep an eye on your unit numbers and unit costs. Stay away from the lady at the fast check out line.  She is slow and is allowed to talk on her personal telephone in the midst of checkout, which should be the time they give you their undivided attention. I will provide no further physical description obviously.When she talks on her phone, she stops all motions expected as a cashier. It must be an accepted practice because the so-called Manager comes and goes from the office immediately beside that check out line and sees this action.Date of experience:July 29, 2023",1

I am very ocd when it comes to car maintenance,  so much I get annoying with it, in Feb I went to have tires rotated,  right after my tires were making a whirling noise  so I went back, that's when I was told they never should have done a rotation because back tires were bad , but in fact it was the front so they didn't even get that right, so in less than 6 months 2 tires were bad, I was told because I need a alignment that's why they were bad, so me being ocd about maintenance right their I scedule the first available appointment  with the dealership ( which they are absolutely amazing)which was the Friday of that week, I get the alignment( it was very little out of alignment)and other services done. I was told by advisor the tops are bad also which is caused by overfilling, I asked a few mechanic ase certified ones, and also did research online as well if it's possible that the over filling of my tires can cause alignments to go out a bit, although it is rare, it can happen because of the height of the of the over filling done in late December I drove like that for roughly a month and a half,  I never once added air to my tires 1 because they were brand new, and why should I have to fix something less than 2 months old, and it was winter. So here is where the gaslighting begins I go back to have them reverse the rotation so I didn't hear that noise, and ask if they could be replaced because I had the warranty they told me no because I had to have alignment that they caused.  When I showed them the paperwork from dealership they changed the excuse to I had a suspension problem because I came in with a wobbly tire issue, I thought maybe didn't tighten nuts tight enough, however I came to discover that between Tallmadge and akron on 76 they have groved roads and if you go slightly over speed limit it will fill like your car is wobbling,  so no I don't have a suspension issue. Furthermore they tried blaming for overfill. I talked with several members of management,  Market Manger and cooperate, they told me to file a claim,  even though it's not a claim issue, I worked for Walmart 13 plus yrs so I know for a fact it can be remedy in store by simply zero out new tires , so I did everything they asked went to store to file claim,  waited a half hour for person that never showed,  left my contact information Noone ever called,  a week later I get a call from claims department saying my claim was denied,  someone from that store filed a claim without my consent writing their narrative to get quickly denied, I was also told by agent that this wasn't a claim issue and needed to be remedy in store and he would send a letter stating that.

They will lose your products and NOT reimburse.I sent my first 5 cartons (60 pcs) to Walmart WFS (Fulfilled by Walmart) using their partner carrier, FedEx. They received 4, and 1 of them was still in FedEx possession after more than a month.I called FedEx, and they said that the box was most likely lost and that they couldn't reimburse me because it was sent using Walmart's account, not mine. So I would have to contact Walmart to get a reimbursement, and they should forward that to me.I opened a dispute with Walmart, provided all the documents they requested, and they said they were sure they received these products and that it may be a technical error that they would investigate it. After they concluded their investigation, they came back and said they couldn't reimburse me as this shipment was received in full. They even updated their WFS platform to show that all 60 pcs were received.BUT, when I clicked on Track Shipment in the WFS platform, I noticed that box was still not received. So they updated just the first stage of their workflow to trick me into thinking this was received. But they couldn't update the Track Shipment page because that was pulling information from Fedex's site. And lo and behold, the box was not delivered.I called FedEx again, and they confirmed that this wasn't delivered. I checked my received inventory in Walmart to see if this was really a technical glitch, and it showed it wasn't delivered either.When I confronted Walmart about this and about what they did to trick me into thinking my shipment was received in full, here's what they answered before closing the case without the possibility of reopening:HelloPlease send all legal actions against Walmart to [link removed].CT Corp is Walmart’s registered agent for service. All subpoenas, complaints or other legal processes should be sent to CT Corp for processing.Thank you,TatianaWalmart Partner SupportThey know that small sellers will never have the budget to go against them in legal action, and they are profiting big time from this. Can you imagine how many sellers like me are in the same situation?As you can see, Walmart copied the FBA model but somehow managed to lower the standard FBA had when it first launched.One other thing to consider with WFS (Fulfilled by Walmart) is that they will assign you fulfillment centers at the other side of the country.

I contacted their customer service and they scheduled a pick-up with a third-party vendor. The item was picked up on June 23, 2023, at around 2:30 p.m. It is now over a month and they have yet to receive the returned item. I contacted Walmart a few weeks ago and was told that it was escalated and that it would take 48 hours to get it resolved. I did not hear back from them.  I contacted them again today. Again, I was told that it would be escalated and that I should expect a follow-up within 48 hours. Interesting that one of the largest logistics, and retail companies in the world cannot locate an item. #walmart #failure #walmartfailureDate of experience:July 25, 2023",1

The reason from them why they just refunded me of the 35.67 .. because they say they gave me 15 dollars discount.. and from that 15 dollars they divide it to how many items you orderd and deduct it to the original price of the milkfish.. so basically from 15 dollars there is 2 dollars more than is been given to one milkfish as a discount.. since its been undelivered they will take back the discount for the milkfish which is nearly 6 dollars or more.. this is the first time i have heard that from a store they will take back the welcome promo discount unless you return the whole order. This is very ridiculuos and funny way of reaping money from customers pocket.. its like giving a child a lollipop ..if there is misdeed you will take it back.. i will never shop at walmart again ..they just make the disount off as a bait but actually if somethings wrong with your order they will take the discount back...RIDICULUOS😡😡😡😡Date of experience:July 23, 2023",1

During that time some customers arrived and received their goods in 10-15 minutes while other customers, like me, were waiting. The only reason I eventually got my order was because I flagged down an employee. A few years ago there was a pick-up counter in the store, which was replaced by an automated locker system. Now the only choice is curbside. Customers are expected to download the mobile app, wait for the order to be ready, check-in prior to arriving, enable location tracking on your phone, notify the store upon arrival, and then... nothing happens. It is a convoluted process executed poorly. Even worse, there were only 8-10 customers in a mostly empty parking lot. How long is the wait when it gets busy? My only reason for placing an online order was because two days ago I could not find the item after searching through the shelves where it was supposed to be in the store.

The WORST experience I have ever experienced! & I’m still dealing with it! So here’s what’s happened so far! Ordered & paid for my tv in full online on July 5, 2023. The app said it would be delivered via Pilot Freight by July 20. I took off work because someone had to be home to sign for it. Waited all day that Monday & nothing. Meanwhile the app said “arrives today”.. by 8pm I thought, “there’s no way they would deliver this late.” They never came & the app still said “arrives today”. The next day the app said, “delayed.” I contacted Walmart costumer support to get an update so that I can make arrangements for work. The first person told me that my tv was delivered & he was escalating the case to someone else for a refund since I hadn’t received it. I waited about 20 min for someone else. That person said it was lost in transit & that I would need to contact the freight company for status. I called the freight company & no one ever answered! The next day, I called Walmart again and they said the tv should be delivered by Thursday the 20th between 3-4pm. I got off work early & guess what!!! NOTHING!! No one came!! I called the freight company & someone answered this time, she said the tv would be there by Friday the 21st between 3-7pm. Friday comes, I had made arrangements (again) to get off early. & guess what!! They called me at noon to say they were 15 min away from my house! So I had to rush from my office to home and as frustrated as I was, I was just happy they were finally coming! The delivery truck was a small white box truck with a little lady & little man, no gear. They were struggling with the huge 130lb box!! They were careless as they carried the heavy ass tv up the stairs, they were carrying it upside down! I open cut open the box to start setting up, and low and behold!! My tv was extremely DAMAGED!! The screen shattered! The tv was curved but it wasn’t a curved tv!! The plastic back part was off of the screen!!!! I was livid!!!!!! After so much money, so much time, frustration they bring me a broken ass tv!!!!! So immediately called Walmart & they started the refund process which includes the same irresponsible good for nothing freight company to come pick up the tv on Tuesday the 25th between 10am-3pm! So now I have to take yet another day from work and HOPE that piece of crap fright company comes to get it. Walmart won’t even give me a refund until they get the tv back & “inspect” it. I’m stressed, frustrated, & annoyed. Now I have a broken tv and all the original packaging waiting in the living room for the freight company to HOPEFULLY come & HOPE that it doesn’t get “lost in transit” again. I can’t even get a refund until 10 days after Walmart receives & inspects it. Very very terrible experience. I will NEVER buy from Walmart.com again. Especially not a big ticket item!!! Their delivery service sucks, their customer service sucks. I’ve bought big tickets items from Conns & Best Buy & have never had anything like this happen. As soon as Walmart refunds me my money, I am buying the same tv at Best Buy.Date of experience:July 22, 2023",1

On July 21, 2023 I am forced to make order Order# 200011009073852 because they sent me a 43"" Sceptre tv. This did not work for me since my work at home is on a Windows pc that uses 5 40"" Sceptre tvs for a 5 multiple display array and a 43"" tv doesn't fit in this 5 tv display array of 40"" tvs. I need this ASAP. I contact customer service and they say the ONLY thing that can be done for a replacement is to return the victimizing product that was never ordered from this victimizing company, wait till they get it back, then and only then at that moment would they then send me the item I actually paid for. That's not going to do! I need this ASAP now that they messed this up!!! They don't care they are victimizing me taking money from me and sending me things I didn't order. I hate them. While I am on phone with customer service my only option to hopefully get one of these tvs I had already bought ASAP is to buy a second 40"" Sceptre tv that I do July 21, 2023.NOW ABOUT THE RETURN! You won't believe this but it is true. I can't take it to my closest Walmart one town away to return it where I do my local Walmart shopping at. They are forcing me to take it to a FedEx Store in Everett WA 4 towns and 45 minutes away from me. This product was only $148 dollars. Between getting the return approval on Walmart phone hold hell through two different operators on the call while simultaneously trying to get this return done with their online chat seeing what way the return will resolve fastest, Walmart steals 40 minute of my time getting the return authorization. Add the 1 1/2 hrs of my travel time there and back 4 cities away for me to deliver this ""victimizing unwelcomed and not ordered product"" to FedEx Everett and I'm in over 2 hrs total at what my employer claims is worth over $30 per hour not counting the gas to go to Everett and back for Walmart. And they don't even thank me for this. This company has some real problems and they don't seem to care.When I started on this journey of replacing a dead 40"" tv I imagined one just showing up exactly like the dead one and hanging it in it's place in a few minutes after it arrived. Fooled me didn't they...The funny thing is, as a principle, if someone sends you something you didn't want to your house, did not order, and didn't buy, then wanted it back, they'd have to jump through your hoops and at your connivence work it out to get it back. I guess Walmart has no principles and thinks they can make you the hoop jumper because they take money from you to send you something you didn't want to your house, did not order, and didn't buy.Date of experience:July 20, 2023",1

This time, as usual, order delayed because I'm told it's a lack of drivers. Seems odd in a city my size. So, I needed this stuff urgently, cancelled the order and went to my Instacart app. Placed order, within the hour the driver/shopper was on it within the hour. Some other horrible experiences; delivered my groceries to wrong address. No sense of urgency with them about the situation, oh hey sorry be a few days. I'm disabled, I don't have these services because of a pandemic. Another great 1, molded yogurt. Yep nice big tub of white greek yogurt, was so excited because I was healing from surgery and couldn't eat much. So, yes you get what you pay for. Sad that poorer people can't get service that is acceptable. Glad at times I can go elsewhere. Walmart use to be the bomb, so disappointed.Date of experience:July 14, 2023",2

She had the meat in 5 bags to cover the smell.The package expired on June 1st 2023.Walmart had & sold expired meat that was over 5 weeks old beyond the expiration date.They fail to rotate products properly. I tried calling the store for over 3 hours to tell them and they refused to answer their phones.I was forced to call the Bakery Department to tell them about the problem. They told me that the front desk does not answer phones on a daily basis and that they are always running around trying to get a hold of management for customer issues.I then drove to the store to protect the public. Walmart had several carts of bad meat that they were pulling from the meat cases.I also contacted Walmart Corporate to report this issue. They could care less. I even asked them for a refund. They refused and told me that I had to return the “package of death” back to the store with my receipt. (Are they serious?). They can keep the $3.32While it is understandable that a occasional package may slip by someone’s attention….I ask myself…..how does a entire section of sausage slip by, especially by more than 5 weeks? So much so, that it produced not just 1 cart but several carts of expired products.There is no excuse for this and Walmart is lucky that the USDA and FDA was not present.Someone could have easily died from this mess and the only thing that Walmart is concerned with is getting their packaging back along with a receipt for a customer refund?If you have Bob Evans Sausage in your fridge or freezer that is dated June 1st 2023…..THROW IT AWAY !!!!!!If you shopped at Walmart in the past 5+ weeks…..check the dates on any meat products. Walmart only cares about the bottom line. 💰. The same bottom that you will land in if you trust them to keep you & your family safe !!!!!⚰️ 🪦 💐.Absolutely disgraceful !!!!Lastly, overall terrible prices and very rude and incompetent staff.If they are in the middle of stocking shelves and you interfere with their work, you are usually greeted with a disappointed look and a “I don’t know” response !!!I just wish that for all these years that I shopped somewhere else !!!There are much better businesses to do business with !!Date of experience:July 11, 2023",1

Upon opening, it only contained 1 very small deck of playing cards and 1 piece of red plastic about the size of a cell phone. I called Walmart and was told the items must be returned in separate packages. I returned both items received (using Walmart return FedEx labels). Walmart claimed the items returned were not in the white and orange package shipped. I contacted the sellers and they said, they didn't ship them, Walmart shipped them and you need to make the claim with Walmart. Walmart refused to refund the $40.97 because they claimed the Ashwaganda bottles were not returned, but refused to show me the pictures where My order was delivered. Therefore, I filed a stop payment with my Bank Of America credit card & my credit card has been credited, even though Walmart contested the refund.

Well when you don’t have a working printer that doesn’t work.Then we have the issue of refunds.I returned an item using FedEx which scares me in itself.First I was told I would receive the refund 5 days from when the carrier got it.After that I was given the complete runaround. “Someone from their Accounting Department would contact me.” Needless to say no one ever did.I had complete documentation of when the item was picked up and delivered to the vendor but that didn’t matter to them. So for one month straight I was talking to them. Finally last night was it. I told them just what I thought of their business practices and I was reporting them to the Better Business Bureau. I immediately received my refund.I honestly feel they weren’t going to issue any refund and hoped I’d give up.Needless to say I canceled my Walmart membership and won’t give them another dime.

Look it's time to go back to the beat of pushing my own cart and knowing I 'll get what I need and not some Sloppy as shopper who has an attitude of I don't give a dam it not my chit. People becareful watch your reciepts use cash only when dealing with Walmart because that whole delivery process is a risky task. Because if you watch closely you'll see if the item is not available no refund goes to your card. Also not only is walmart stealing from you so are the drivers too and I do have proof but what can I do I'm just a small fry up against a Giant Corp. Again customer Service attitude in the work places now is I don't give a dam about yo chit. Im only here for the hourly pay and nothing more.

The day of the installation I received a notification that the installation had been canceled due to a delay. I received no explanation and no tires. I had to call customer service on two separate occasions, still no refund. I had to initiate a dispute with PayPal. I had to have a long chat with a customer service rep from walmart.com that insisted that my refund was coming just to be patient. It's been 10 days I have received one cent in my bank account for a refund with no explanation as to where the rest of my money is. I have had no communication via email regarding this transaction being canceled or that are refund was issued.

Try to get tires mounted, told I had to make appointment. Made appointment, man said 2 tires. I said no we paid for 4 I want to make appointment to get the tires mounted. He said he doesn't have 4 tires. We call other locations. Changed pick up location. Had appointment for noon Tuesday. Arrived early for appointment after CONFIRMING  everything over the phone. They can't find appointment or order at first. They eventually found the tire order but no order for mounting the tires. I asked the guy who wrote up the order, if mounting and balancing were free if you bought a set because I heard they were. He said no, I had to pay separate. He showed me the 2 options. I went with the more expensive option since I was told I had to pay for it. After waiting 3 1/2 hours they inform me they put 3 tires on and broke a lug nut. They sent me 10 miles away to get it fixed. I asked them to call and make an appointment, Walmart said they did. Got to the shop they had no idea what I was talking about. Spent a couple hours there having all the lug nuts replaced. Went back to Walmart the get 4th tire put on. No one at the automotive counter knew how to do that. They told me the automotive manager would be there soon. I waited 20 minutes before a different worker said manager just went to lunch, he'll be back in an hour. Automotive closes at 7pm. I find a store supervisor, she goes back to automotive, the man who broke the lug nut closed the doors to automotive and said he wasn't going to do it because the lug nuts wouldn't come off and he closed the doors already. This made me angry. It was after 6pm Tuesday. I had been there since 11:30 am I said YOU broke the lug nut, I got it fixed along with every other ""F""ing lug nut so there is no reason why you can't do your ""F""ing job.  Then he got slick. I said I'm reporting this entire thing and you to Corporate. He said so, go ahead, nothing will happen. So, manager finally comes back and has them put the tire on. Now I'm getting ready to pay bill and I'm told mounting and balancing are free if you buy 4 tires, but you got the extended package and that's not covered, but since you had a bad experience I'll knock $30 off your ticket.

Pain right there! Then - get this - they deliver TO MY DOOR within 2 hours - FROM A LOCAL STORE - the 2 items that were of the 3 that needed to “ship.”There’s so much wrong with this. If you’re going to send 2 things - not really “shipped” - then why don’t you offer to grab my other items at the same time!! The pick up order was done at about the same time.Also when I placed the order, I clicked on Deliver From Store option for the 6 pickup items and 8.95 came up. Huh? You were already going to do that!!So what should be an easy order of 9 things, 7 of which were very ordinary every day items, turns into confusion, complications and a waste of my time. Not at all a pleasant shopping experience!They also NEED to put “Seller” (or whatever they call it) up to the TOP on the LEFT hand side to make it faster and easier to just see Walmart stuff. You have to scroll all the way down to click Walmart and eliminate all the 3rd party crap out there. On each item. Maybe there’s a way to do it overall but if there is, it isn’t apparent.I rarely shop Walmart online because the few times I have it is AWFUL! I did this time because I wanted a pot they had, so I thought I’d throw in other things I needed and just ship it all (like lots of other stores!). So much for that. And don’t say I did it wrong because I didn’t. Shopping online is not rocket science - or at least it shouldn’t be!They need to fire their web designers and start over.

They just dont care i would originally get  refunded for spoiled and damaged items without having to go physically to the store now they changed their policy again and all has to be brought in to customer  service now. I am physically disabled cannot drive which now makes this service not a plus for homebound and disabled people. Its just not worth it. Unless your into paying someone to deliver rancid food to your door. Delivery times are a joke. The trial went well as soon as we were paying for service all went to hell delays, not being delivered but charged for. And unreliable delivery times for me i'm always here so. But if you leave your home you may come home to bags of spoiled items left at unreliable times. I'm totally at a loss at how many times i thought what if i was not here? bad customer service, they are polite but not all that helpful and having to explain it all to several people I have spent hours online with them to get half resolved issues and all the other problems ?Date of experience:June 19, 2023",1

When I tried to order a 1/2 gallon container of Bluebell ice cream I was given only two choices. I know walmart has more than two flavors of Bluebell ice cream. They listed ALL of the great value choices (great value is the walmart brand). When I tried to order my choice of Bluebell ice cream from my purchase history it showed that the only flavor of ice cream i have EVER ordered was buttered pecan. Total effing bullsh*t! I NEVER buy buttered pecan!!! walmart is the epitome of everything that is wrong in this world!!! It goes without saying that Sam Walton is a VERY, VERY disappointed father!

One time after spending hundreds, they apparently never debit the money so they waited until the end of the month to debit 2 months back worth of charges but of course how did I know that the items were never paid for if I saw the money leave my acct and received a receipt once the items were paid for so once I added money in my acct, guess who took the money Walmart.

Then called and chat one more time, and the representative rescheduled my times lot, because she said that's why it was not being delivered. I was supposed to get my order at 5-6pm, and at 4:27 while I was picking up my kid from school got a notification that my order was cancelled upon my request??

I called Walmart to let them know that my item had not been delivered about 20 mins after receiving a text that it was. Said it was delivered in front of my garage which I don’t have. When I spoke to the rep. She said I have to call back 2 days later after 8:00 PM if I still have not received it. So now we are a week out and still no product. So I called 3 days later. I told the rep I paid $51 for the umbrella and it’s not $71 can he just re-issue it. I was told he can’t and I have to order the umbrella again. Once it’s shipped I have to call them again to get the difference of the original price. I’m like why do I need to do so much for a non-deliverable item please help make this process easier for me. He said he will call some line to help me get rush delivery. I was on hold with him for 35 mins and then transferred to another rep. To discuss my issue all over again. 20 mins later and of hearing their annoying hold music still no umbrella or resolve.

The corporate management does not hire enough employees to provide adequate customer service to their customers. They rely on technology to do their jobs for them. Then they have an employee at the door to check items and receipts, making you feel like a criminal because they won’t do their jobs and check you out at the registers. They make you check yourself out. Not to say the price increases on everything. Walmart is not a high quality store, is for low paid, low income, average Americans, that work their a** off to get by in life. Not to say it out other older chains, like Kmart, etc.. out of business. I remember a time where they checked you out, talked to you, even took your groceries to the car. Those days are llllooonnnggg gone!!! But being policed every time you leave the store?! That is BS! Plain and simple, not to say highly unprofessional of the company to have standards such as this.

Brooke S.,1review,GB,2023-06-12T08:21:35.000Z,"I am a victim of FraudI ordered an item from Walmart.com last month, May of 2023. Today I opened the package, and realized that I had received the wrong item. I had ordered a heavy-duty folding cart at a cost of $133.27, and instead, I received a very heavy folding COT, with no wheels, like, a type of BED. I contacted customer service by phone today, 6/11/23, in order to process a return/refund for this item. I had to call twice, my first call was only 2 min long, it was not helpful, so I disconnected with that rep, and tried calling again. The second rep followed Walmart's policy, and contacted the 3rd party seller to request both a refund for the item I had ordered, and a pickup of the incorrect item. Walmart apparently requires its 3rd party sellers to contact the customer and start the refund/return process within 48 hours. If they don't, Walmart will process the it themselves. Simple enough. BUT... while on the second call, a few minutes in, I noticed an email appear in my inbox, verifying an order just made from my Walmart.com account, which I had not authorized! This was for a total of 4 items, in the amount of $697.40! That is a LOT of money. Three of these items I had never seen before. The 4th item was a re-order of the original item I was calling about. At this point, on the second call, the rep could see that the order had just come through, while I was speaking to him, and recognized that it had to be a fraudulent order. I was seeing it and freaking out about it in real time. He immediately processed a ""forced cancellation"" of all 4 items on this new order. He also acknowledged that it was far too coincidental for this new order to have contained a re-order of the original item I was calling about. I asked the rep who could have done this, and he explained that he had no way of telling on his end, but did provide me with the corporate number to call, to have someone at the Walmart company research this. I pointed out that this action was criminal, and that I would be reporting it to authorities on both the state and federal levels (meaning the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and my state's Office of the Attorney's General). The rep agreed that this would be the correct course of action. So, I wanted to alert all customers of Walmart.com that this fraud occurred, and that they may want to think twice about ordering from Walmart.com. It seems likely that the fraud was committed by someone who was aware of the item I was originally calling about. I will leave it at that.

I called customer service and they tried to reach him but he didn't answer his phone and the manager at the delivery center didn't answer either. Customer service said all she could do is cancel the order and give me a $25 credit which I could use to re-order my order. I checked and she never canceled the order.

I said it is 9:50 right now and the customer service person assured me that the delivery would be made within the next 10 minutes. It never was.

Mika Serpent,2reviews,US,2023-06-09T19:10:48.000Z,"Walmart, as a company...Walmart, as a company, offers competitive pricing for products of decent to good quality. It is commendable that their employees receive numerous benefits and have ample opportunities for career growth and promotions. With dedication, time, and effort, a career at Walmart can be a viable option. However, there are areas that require improvement. Firstly, their training program falls short as the training videos only provide limited guidance, and much of the job description is learned through on-the-job experience. A revamp of their training program is necessary. Secondly, the level of professionalism exhibited by Walmart employees is basic at best. While it is not expected to have an overly enthusiastic environment, even a simple greeting or basic customer service seems to be lacking. It is important to note that this review reflects both my experiences as a shopper and a former employee. Although I have had some positive encounters, there have unfortunately been unpleasant incidents as well.

Since then, Wal-Mart has gotten lazy, careless, and is becoming a useless place to shop.

This happened recently when Francis watched me check out at the self checkout right over my shoulder, and then harassed me for my receipt right after I finished checking out. I politely ignored Francis, but this is when he screamed a a storm of curses at me. This is the 4th offence where i was harassed like this, at this Walmart. This whole situation is unacceptable behavior for all Walmarts to not have policies in place for greeters to not harass customers. There is no policy where I am obligated to show proof of purchase, therefore Walmart is legally liable for harassment everytime they falsly acuse customers of theft by asking for proof of purchase at the door. This harassment causes uncomfortable emotional distress and makes me feel unwelcome at my public store, when in fact, it is the harassing false accusing criminals that are not welcome in society let a lone the store. If Walmart want to ask for receipts at the door they need to be doing so under a policy like Sam's club or Costco, until that policy is written, they have absolute no right harassing and false accusing paying customers such as myself, because it is illegal and Walmart should be held liable for their crimes. Also, Walmart has no right to discriminate against me and my future visits to the store, for abiding by the law and store policies and refusing to show receipts and be falsly accused and harassed, because discrimination is a crime as well, and they should be held liable for such ""shadow bans"" or remembering my face with hatred and resentment to make me feel unwelcome in my own Walmart.Date of experience:March 01, 2023",1

A additional day or 2 went by, still no PS5, so we inquired once again, and were told it was picked up by a driver days ago... Ok, so where is our PS5?... Long story short, Walmart just stuck a sticker on the PS5 showing the item was paid for. No box or anyway to hid the expensive item, so the driver decided to pick up the PS5 and keep it for themselves!! My husband called the sheriff's office to file a theft case, but was told the issue had to be handled by Walmart. Walmart told us that the order would be canceled in a couple days then the tracking runs out, at which time my mother-in-law would be issued a refund, and that was all they plan to do regarding this matter. The driver stole our PS5 with no repercussions whatsoever. Got to keep this free PS5, still has their delivery job, and meanwhile,  my mother-in-law is still waiting for her refund, and my husband never ended up getting a PS5 for his birthday after all this.

I walked into Walmart about 8pm, got a shopping cart and started my shopping. About 8:30pm when I was almost done with my shopping lists but needed to make one last stop at isle 18, hardware section. I left my shopping cart at isle 18 because I could not find my item there and walked around the next two isle (about 3 minutes later) and when I came back my shopping cart was gone (So glad I did not have any valuable items in the cart).  I know I did not move my cart from isle 18, so I walked around looking for my shopping cart (full of my groceries for the upcoming week with my shopping bags) and came back to isle 18 and it was nowhere to be found. I was very frustrated because it was getting late and I didn't want to start over with my shopping lists. I noticed an employee was working close to isle 18 so I asked if he knew what happened to my cart......either he didn't understand me or just ignored me and walked away. Frustrated, I walked around the store again to look for it myself, it's been about 10-15 minutes later now. As I was walking back to isle 18, I noticed another employee (a different one) working close by so I asked if he knew what happened to my cart and this one actually called to see if anyone had taken a cart from isle 18. About a minute or two later, Wilma the manager came around the corner and admitted that she took the cart because the store was closing (store closes at 10pm and it was only 8:40pm when she took my cart). As much as I was frustrated, her constant excuse to me was, ""THE STORE IS CLOSING"".  She took my cart at 8:40pm and the store doesn't close until 10pm!!!!!! This manager doesn't know the first thing how to manage the store and she clearly shows that customers don't matter.This may not seem like a big deal to anyone out there, even the management at Walmart but I was very frustrated because I had invested my time to get my grocery shopping done for the upcoming week (groceries for my family). My shopping cart was not taken by another customer but by some lazy manager who wanted to get home early with full pay. She clearly does not have the humility to apologize for her mistakes but instead she makes the constant excuse that ""THE STORE IS CLOSING!"".Date of experience:May 28, 2023",1

Where to begin...The bad?(You really need to read this all!)First, they drove small business bankrupt. Then create unemployed people. They consume incredible land destruction from football stadium sized store acreage. And used to be one of the lowest paid jobs around, that many people were embarrassed to admit they worked at.That said, ""waaaaah"" if you got driven out of business because any other store out beat you in prices, move to the USSR where capitalism isn't allowed. Who in the world ""don't"" shop around for the lowest cost these days? Or any days? Really? If your business was so much better, how is it still so small? Probably overpriced by a mile. Capitalism? Yea! We fought for it, got it, then cry because it effected our mark-up strategy. ""Waaaaah"" they took jobs, but only the small ""going nowhere"" business owners jobs, their clerks got rehired at the stores that took away the other job. Malls? Uhhh, unless you 14, who has the time, energy to walk a mile long cablecade of overpriced merchandise with barbie and ken doll snooty employees while you eat a mustard topped pretzel? Walmart has everything there just about at much less, and you know their employees aren't exactly stuck up either.Property destruction? You can't store, display and sell bulk merchandise in a trailer. Duhh, it's gonna take acreage to roof all the things ""we all buy"" without having to drive to 5 different stores located over a city wide span. And now, their employees are well paid if not at least paid decently. Management getting too high a bonus for your liking? Really? Ok, if your boss offered you a whopper of a bonus for top sales or meeting a quota, are you really saying that you'd turn it down because you feel it's too much? Let's not be liars. You'd jump around at a rally too. Heck, I'd jump around just at the thought of a bonus being offered! And for less!Walmart isn't perfect, yet. But a company got successful because ""we"" as the people, went, saw, liked, and supported what they offered. Not 100% are going to get the perfect experience everytime. But no matter what anyone says, everyone ""still"" goes back there because they know, fewer stores offer the variety, at the lowest cost, with awesome return policy, than Walmart.  Good brand names, 1 building, with handicapped scooters, a restraunt or fast food to eat at, a pharmacy, grocery, sporting goods store wrapped in one stop in the day.  Ya, go on to ""Ricks bike store"" then to ""Derrick's local independently owned grocery store and see the price difference.

They have no record of my email or phone number. They had no record of my spouse's email or phone number. Both email and phone number are required to set up an account/ membership. I began my quest for cancellation of this membership in February  2022. In JuneThey could find months of charges at 12.95 per month using all 16 digits of my card that was being used but could not refund to card. They could not find a membership ID number/account number connected to the charges.This was the only unusual unknown charge to my card in 12 months. My first month my bank refunded me but after that they would not refund without Walmart sending them the refund. I was hoping to avoid canceling the card as it was used to make automated payments on all my monthly bills. I contacted them multiple times with a promise of call backs or emails and the refund would no problem. The contact never came and neither refund. I finally had no choice but cancel the card and reestablish all auto payments.  I escalated to the president's office and a member of his escalation team informed me I would not be refunded or compensated though they could not find an account connected to my card.I avoid Walmart like the plague with the exception of the pharmacy and block all their ads and emails at this point.This app would not allow me to go back to February 2022 when this shenanigans began.Date of experience:May 24, 2022",1

So I called customer service I was told to take them back and exchange them or get a refund which I did and they never took them back I was told the same thing you cannot return them. So I called customer service and took them back on Sunday May 21, 2023 the pants cost $32.97 with tax $36.06 total I was told that the pants was not returnable so I called customer service and they said talk to the manage. So I took them back and talk to an Asian lady who said she was the manager and she told me that I could not bring the pants back because she didn't believe that I bought them in the first place even though I had receipt in my hand and a receipt on my phone and the debit card in which the pants was purchased on this kind of hassle African Americans, Hispanics and Latinos get every time we shop Walmart and have to return something that doesn't fit or that is damaged they will not allow us to return it or exchange it. In my case all I wanted to do was exchange the pants for a pair that wasn't damaged I was told I had to leave the store before they called the police. This happens more often than not and it's a shame because Walmart is the closest clothing store and my neighborhood and to be treated like a criminal is not fair and if I was Chinese they would have given me the money back or they would have allowed me to exchange them.Date of experience:May 20, 2023",1

I moved recently and for the past three weeks; over TWELVE of my online orders have been canceled. Each cancellation resulted in me contacting customer service; being transferred numerous times; and being hung up on and no one has called me back. I’ve spoken to at least five managers; and each one has promised me that the issue is being escalated and should be resolved within 24-hours. I finally got so frustrated that I cancelled my account altogether and not ONE employee asked me why or tried to resolve me issue. I was told that I’ve used up half of my membership and they were unable to issue me a refund  I politely said okay and disconnected the call.

But I'm f****** tired man I go to work I worked outside on ladders all day yesterday I don't want to check myself out especially when I'm spending almost $300. So I'm not going back. I mean if your prices were a little more reasonable and you paid me like $10 to check myself out I might take that. But I'm not going to work my ass off all week and then go spend a s*** ton of money at your store and have to check myself out That's just not going to happen. And I hope people do steal a bunch of s*** from you that way to make up for all the money you're stealing from us. Yeah I'll be going online for all my s***.

Dee Strohl,14reviews,US,2023-05-12T06:21:37.000Z,"Walmart punishes me for their mistakesSo far I think I’ve had two successful deliveries but I’ve tried to make several orders. Two orders somehow were lost in the system and the store was unable to be contacted. I had no choice but to cancel the orders, but this still counted as ‘returns’. So then when I tried to reorder these missing items, the orders were immediately cancelled because of my account being suspended for ‘return violations’. And even though I contacted customer service and thought I had gotten this resolved, every time they cancel another order it all adds up to more ‘returns’ on my end. So I had to use a different phone number and a different card to make any successful orders after that. Then, on a shipping order, I happened to notice that online it said order was attempted but unsuccessful. I don’t know what happened but I did not receive any text or calls and I was definitely home sitting near the front door. No one attempted to deliver anything. I also have a security camera on my front door that proves there was no one trying to deliver my package. There’s no updates and no more information about this order and when I contacted customer service they suggested that I cancel and reorder. I can only assume that this will cause the ‘return violations’ issue to reappear. Why does Walmart think it’s ok to punish their customers for THEIR mistakes?! How are they still able to do business like this?Date of experience:May 11, 2023",1

To no avail, the bar continued to change so that the company could make more money.  1) when you shop for items, the shoppers are allowed to accept higher priced items unless you choose not to change the items. Fruits and Vegetables cost are higher than the advertised price. Walmart makes it tricky to replace or deny items to decrease the price, therefore be vigilant.  Try different methods of making option changes. If you use your cell phone or iPad,  change to a laptop to change items 2) be aware that even if you are signed up for the free delivery/pick-up program. They have added a minimum to each order.  If you are below the minimum order, they will charge an additional price IT IS NOT WORTH SIGNING UP FOR FOR FREE PICK UP/DELIVERY DUE TO THE NEW CHARGES.  3) Lastly,  be mindful that the Walmart website is set up to find the best match for the items you search for. They make it tricky to select the lowest to highest price items. Don't give up, this option icon changes from week to week to confuse the shopper.   This also helps the company to charge you to purchase higher-priced items.BE MINDFUL AND TAKE YOUR TIME!Date of experience:May 06, 2023",1

Hours on the phone with agents who I could not understand well, and finally supervisors who explained, I have to wait while Walmart contacts the seller!  This was not what I was told.

I asked for customer service to refund me the difference, since I was not contacted to arrange a substitute and had to pay full price for the other cereals. They said no so I asked to speak to a supervisor. They proceed to leave me on hold for 20 minutes and then I gave up. Never again.Date of experience:April 27, 2023",1

It's wide enough and long enough. Lot of times brands don't make their clothes long enough to cover our big bellies. This jacket is perfect. I washed it in cold but didn't dry and it did not shrink I think I'm going to buy another one and tuck it away in case something happens to this one.

Dee-Dee,1review,US,2023-04-26T03:21:08.000Z,"Beware of ordering for pickup!Do not purchase anything online. Horrible customer service and they rip you off. I ordered over $200 worth of merchandise. The paper towels was not available for pickup and they would ship to me. When I looked at the receipt I was charged over 46 for one small package of bounty paper towels, 8 roll package. My receipt reflected I was charged shipping too, total bill $55.67. I am not joking. Thus I contacted the supplier for this order, Clean it Supply, and they said I had to wait for the order to arrive before starting a return. The order was over a week late with delayed shipping. Okay, order arrived, weighs less than 2 pounds! I go on line to return the product. I have to take the a FedEx store. Okay. I take the paper towels today to start the return and the UPS store doesn’t take FedEx. Then I go to Walmart and they cannot take it back. They told me to go to a FedEx location. I then drive to a FedRx location and they said I have to take it to another FedEx location 44 miles one way away! Two hours later and I still have these rip off paper towels! I’m so upset! Unacceptable to  charge four times the normal price using a second party supplier. Thus, I will be requesting the CFPB investigate Walmart and their supplier. I will also file a complaint with e-commerce and the attorney general in my state. And I am contacting my credit card company to dispute this purchase. If I don’t have to pay for the paper towels I will donate them to the animal shelter. Lesson learned.

You see just because the item is listed ""in stock"" on their website does not mean it is ""in stock"" in the local store, which is patently absurd.  Take for instance the order on 4/22/23 delivered at 6:00 p.m.  According to the local store, Great Value Orange Juice was unavailable inferring that Saturday afternoon there was an incredible RUSH to buy orange juice...or possibly the shopping assistant was too lazy to go to the back of the store and pick up the orange juice.....you speculate.  This isn't the FIRST TIME this has occurred.  Customer Service ""script"" answer says just because it is IN STOCK ONLINE does not mean it is IN STOCK at the store.  So what good is the online inventory to the customer if it is a gamble EVERY TIME YOU CHOOSE AN ITEM?  Wal Mart is telling EVERY CUSTOMER TO CALL THE STORE BEFORE PLACING AN ORDER.  Sounds efficient to me!   So based on Wal-Mart's direction, I plan to call the store WEEKLY TO GET THE LATEST INVENTORY before placing the order for the 87 year old customer.

I had been having pretty decent luck until the past two months, and then overcharging (in the store at the checkout counter!!!) and then when you try to get Customer Service (should be renamed to CUSTOMER TORTURE!) on the phone, they demand you bring the receipt into the store to fix their mistake.  For me that's a 62 mile R/T from home.  Last overcharge for over 20 dollars was done over the phone, but this time the Customer Agent sez; ""that person screwed up..that's not how it's supposed to be done..""  Today I spent about an hour and a half total on the horn with them but then I just decided ENOUGH IS ENOUGH and cancelled the '3' items I had just ordered yesterday, being I was unsure if they'd even have them in the store today when I went.  In any case as nice as the rep in the P.I. was (seems all call centers are there now, banks, everything..) she couldn't stop the 'yet to be shipped' shipments coming to me.  They will be 'declined' as always because I'm finally after all of this time finished giving them the benefit of the doubt.  Had I tried to 'steal' the item they 'double rang up' when I had only ONE of them, no doubt I would have been trotted out by police to 'splain that' to them (no, this is NOT OREIZGONE!)  One checkout girl at one checkout station and everything else was self-checkout.  I told the woman that I would have pre-ordered online but I cannot trust them to give me the whole order albeit I'm sure I'd be charged for it all even if it wasn't all there :(This is the new gig in America.  ZERO customer support, ZERO customer service.  Honest shoppers who really are okay with paying for what we do get, certainly, with inflation, aren't up for paying for crap we DON'T GET :(  This was it today.

Elsie Class,2reviews,US,2023-04-16T01:19:25.000Z,"Today 4/15/23 at 6 pmToday 4/15/23 at 6 pm. I went to Walmart Super Center at Lincoln Highway in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. I got two bags of medium grain rice brand Rico rice.  I went to pay in line #6, when I got there I didn’t realize that one of the bags was broken, when I told the cashier I told her it was broken, she told me to get another one, I asked her if it was possible to another employee to get for me due that it was far away, she told me that I had to get my self, I went all the way to get the rice, when I came back she told that I have to go and pay in another line because that one was already close, I told her I was there and that she told me to get another bag of rice, she kept saying that I have to pay in another line. I asked to talk to the manager, she said “the manager is right here” she told the manager that I wanted to talk to her but the manager completely ignored me, she didn’t even acknowledge me, she completely  ignored me, at that moment I decided to go to one to a self check out lines, after I paid I went to my car and at that moment I realized the other bag of rice was broken too with 2 holes. I went back to the store, got another bag, went to costumer service and changed it. It was such a horrible day. My complain is about Walmart selling articles in bad conditions and the treatment I got from the cashier in line #6 and bad costumer service from the manager which apparently is from the Philippine, she is skinny, dark and not very friendly.Date of experience:April 15, 2023",1

For some reason, though sold and shipped by Walmart, I could not be provided with the instructions because it’s not a Walmart product (or something like that). I had to put in the work to call and get my own instructions. Not only was it not offered that Walmart call for me, the specifically told me they would not do it.Irvin did look up a number for me to call; supposedly the manufacturer. After calling it, and finding out it was disconnected, I spent another 30 mins on the phone with Walmart. I was told they could do nothing and weren’t willing to do anything but give me more numbers to call.I got rid of my children’s beds to make room for this and set it up today. I also took the day off, as did my husband, to get it all set up as a surprise for them. Now, they have no beds, no surprise, my husband and I lost money for the day, and for who knows how long this will go on. What I was offered was no more than “$25 because our system doesn’t allow for us to credit more than that.”This has displaced my family and, in the end, cost us more than the purchase. Lost wages and hurt children with no beds.I will NEVER be purchasing for Walmart online again and will strong advise/continue to post to encourage others don’t either.Date of experience:April 14, 2023",1

The two employees nearby stood and watched me put my money in, never said a word. Mgr Michelle told me she would have used her head, implying I hadn’t. Not only was this rudely insulting, she said it in front of three front end girls one of whom (no name tag but said her name was Kay) felt empowered enough to say loudly “I agree with Michelle, he should have used his head.” When I called the number on the receipt it rang for approximately 3 full minutes before I gave up.

Went to electronics and decided on the Samsung Galaxy A23 5g. I asked if would need a refill card or could I buy one when I set up the phone. The merchant said ""yes you would need one if you don't already have an account with straight talk"". I didn't have service so I purchased it and the A23 then continued my shopping. I gathering the that I needed, stopped at the self check out, waited at the front entrance for the phone to charge. Tried sending up the phone but the activation key disappeared when I put in my information. Someone not only reported me for STEALING THE PHONE I JUST PURCHASED, but they put my imei and my name on the internet giving people access to my device. I tried to returned the first cell phone and they acted as if I was trying to STEAL THE SIM CARD FROM THE PHONE I JUST PURCHASED.  The two associates checked and everything was still there and we decided since I couldn't return the refill cad that wasn't scratched or damaged, and I asked, then I should exchange the phone. I did but they ask the same merchant the first time to checked me out again. I knew they were  aware. Same issue, but I tried to resolve it myself. I couldn't, no second phone,  no text now. So I went to the customer service desk and they tried again to send to Electric with my full cart. I said no can speak the store manager.  Two people acted as if they didn't know what a store manager was but I did speak to someone. She approached recording me and people who knows me knows I hate that. I told her i do not give you permission to record me she continued. She blamed me not the merchant. She had someone who was not manager listening to our conversation, neither were managers. The woman came with coach on a yellow tag. Said she cant over rule the woman who was recording no refund. Police come and started recording me on his body came. Started yelling me check body cam.

Macho Comacho,1review,US,2023-04-09T02:22:18.000Z,"Deceptive Pricing, Refusal to Correct, and Rude Customer ServiceI was at the Walmart on Slappy Blvd, Albany, Georgia.  My wife was with me, but we were buying items separately, each with our own money.  We saw liquid stevia at a certain price - labeled clearly beneath it.  I grabbed one and she grabbed one.  She picked up one three-pack of instant yeast and I picked up two three-packs of instant yeast.  So, she and I both get in self check-out line and she is in front of me.  Keep in mind that we were paying as two separate customers, so in theory, and as far as Walmart was concerned, we might have not even known one another.  Anyway, she scans her Great Value brand liquid Stevia and the price was significantly higher than advertised on the shelf.  She reports this to a worker, who does an override and gives her the advertised on-shelf price.  She next scans the Great Value Fast Rising Instant Yeast.  AGAIN, not the on-shelf advertised price!  She shows this to the same worker, who once again does an override so that she pays the correct advertised price.  I am right behind my wife in checkout line with my Stevia and my two packs of Fast Rising Instant Yeast.  I request the same override that the person in front of me (who happened to be my wife - but Walmart didn't know that) got.  The Walmart worker replied that his manager would only let him override one item - - so, he said to me, (and I quote), ""That's on you."" (How was it ""on me""?  This was Walmart's ""false on-shelf pricing"", and Walmart's refusal to override it and give me the advertised on-shelf price!)  So...the person directly in front of me in checkout line gets an override for the advertised shelf price - - and I do not, and am forced to either pay the inflated/non-advertised price or just not buy the items at all.  So, I elected to leave the items there.Date of experience:April 06, 2023",1

Then it takes them 2 to 3 hours to do a balance. When it takes them this long just to do a balance/rotation. Are they really saving us money. When it takes them this long? I've been to other oil change places. The price is about the same. I was out of this place in 30 minutes. Unlike Walmart takes them at least an hour to do an oil change. If they even do it correctly. Be careful Walmart isn't what they used to be. My tires seem worse now before I came. Walmart is a joke now. Be careful of what u buy at walmart and get done to your car at Walmart. Do ur research people. They have changed and it is not for the better of the people.Date of experience:April 02, 2023",1
H H,2reviews,US,2023-04-03T14:04:49.000Z,"Wal-Mart never order onlineI ordered several items several days in advance. The morning of an 8 am scheduled delivery, they emailed me at 4am to cancel a key item that was listed in stock on their non grocery website. I then spoke with them and cancelled the order with their driver, as they advised. Since then I have spent MANY hours online and on the phone, been promised a refund many times, and have not received it (even received a noreply email stating they would process it), I have received however many emails for my satisfaction reviews of their products including their out of stock item. Unbelievable repeatedly deceptive service. Pleasant workers but complete Incompetence on the part of the store. The repeated nature of this experience makes me wonder if this is their unwritten policy since they are unavailable by email. Likely hoping their customers will give up since they waste so much of our time.Date of experience:March 08, 2023",1

Scott Underwood,1review,US,2023-04-02T07:05:00.000Z,"This is something I want everyone to be…This is something I want everyone to be aware of about Walmart if you are buying tires.My wife bought a set of 4 tires from the Walmart site online.  She paid for them and set up an appointment.On the day of the appointment we went to the store to get the tires installed.  When we got there we were informed that because we bought the tires online we were not able to get any road hazard warranty on them!!  Nothing on their site said anything about this when she purchased the tires!  We needed the tires badly.  The old ones were worn and were leaking, and if we'd told them what I would have liked to tell them we would have had to get them somewhere else, set up another appointment and probably have to wait another week or so to get in, so we had no other choice but to purchase the tires without the road hazard warranty.  My theory for Walmart to do business this way is because they buy their tires from some 3rd world country and they are made much cheaper, so they don't want to offer any warranty with them.  Just like I read they do with their TV sets.  I read they pay manufacturers to make them cheaper than they do for other stores so they can sell them cheaper, but this is only something I read and I don't know for sure if this is true.  I would not surprise me though.I called Walmart customer service 800 number, and just passed around from one person to another.  I told them the whole story several times and also said I wanted a call back.  As yet I have not heard back, and I don't suppose I will either.This is the craziest thing I've ever heard.  I don't believe in paying extra for most warranties, but with tire you'd be a fool not to!  I can't believe they do business this way!!  Walmart is really going down hill.  The store that I always go to in Altoona, Iowa is one of the worst stores I've been to.  Shelves stocked incorrectly, pricing is all wrong, but never in the customer's favor.  The merchandise that is on the shelf is a lot times priced differently than the displayed price.  One time I kept track and it was $14 off in Walmarts favor.  I've called the 800 number so many times that they know my voice now, and nothing ever changes!!Now they are doing away with a lot of their own Great Value brand (GV) and only putting the more expensive items on the shelf.  I can't explain the reason for this.  I believe I've put up with about all I can from Walmart, and I'm considering going to another place.  There was once a time when they were a good place to go for a little cheaper pricing, they were never great, but I could deal with them from bargain hunters' standpoint, now I feel I can longer in good faith continue to shop there.I mostly wanted to tell our story about the tires.Caveat emptor everyone!!!  For those of you that don't speak Latin, it means ""LET THE BUYER BEWARE""!!Thanks for reading!Date of experience:April 01, 2023",1

And I also got a scam notification from the debit card, apparently, a criminal is/was working at the local Walmart and attempting to open an account with my debit card money thru the bank of course. Now you all know that people who work at Walmart are mostly black and Mexican. I know is one of the employees.To make a long story short, I told you, the lady that email replied is a Mexican, you figured that out.

Abilara,2reviews,CA,2023-03-17T06:15:07.000Z,"Don't do it! Buyer Beware!I ordered an outdoor grill from Walmart.com. It came very quickly and I assembled it myself. When I went to light the grill, one side wouldn't light. I contacted the manufacturer and they ended up sending parts 2 different times, which I replaced, (which I shouldn't have had to do with a brand new grill that cost over $300) to no avail. I still couldn't get the one side to light, so the manufacturer told me to return it to the store. I started an online return, got a code to show to the cashier when I returned the grill and went to the store for the return. After waiting in line at customer service for awhile, and explained about the return, I was questioned about it. Then a Walmart employee came and told me that I needed the instructions for the grill to ensure that all the parts were there. I told her that all the parts were there with a few extra that the manufacturer sent to me. She was very rude about it. I explained how I started the online return and had a return code, but she still insisted that I needed the instructions to make sure no parts were missing. Mind you, I live about 45 minutes from the closest Walmart and asked the employee if I could leave the grill at the store and go back home to get the manual. She insisted that I call 1-800-walmart for their advice. I tried getting through to that number and was unable to speak to a real person. I finally went back to customer service and told them I couldn't get through to 1-800-walmart and the employee asked me if I wanted to speak to a manager and I said yes.Finally, a manager showed up and I explained the whole situation to her and she eventually approved the return of the grill.The first employee that told me I had to have the paperwork was totally rude and didn't even listen to what I had to say.

Found all the shaving cream is now locked up with the razors. So apparently I’m supposed to wander the halls of Walmart hoping to find an associate that can unlock the cabinet. The first 5, yes FIVE associates I found couldn’t speak a lick of English. Being an English speaker I feel discriminated against in my own country. I guess Walmart is now only for Hispanics. Why would a store lock up normal use items and not station a person there to open it? I’m supposed to go on a 15 minute expedition to hunt for an English speaking someone? Do you want my business or not Walmart? It’s getting a bit ridiculous and I guess I’m going to buy everything I need that isn’t groceries at Publix, Walgreens and Best Buy since you can’t even provide help in our native tongue. I spend an average of $1200 a month at Walmart. I guess I’ll spend half of it somewhere else from now on. This isn’t the first time I’ve needed help and can’t get it.

Lynne,1review,US,2023-03-11T03:49:45.000Z,"Should Walmart stay in business?Walmart.com tells customers they are ONLY responsible for selling items, and are NOT responsible for ensuring their customers receive them - even if problems originate at Walmart. In my experience, orders are frequently delayed several days. When not delivered, customers are told to wait two more days - then told their only option is a refund. They don't even attempt to resolve the issue. During my most recent bad experience (there have been many) they refused to replace the item as requested. When I insisted they said the item was out-of-stock which was not true (other colors were available). Clearly Walmart believes it's cheaper to issue refunds than train customer service staff, and they don't care what problems this causes their customers. Advice: don't order anything you actually need from Walmart.com. Better still don't use Walmart at all. Personally, I've had enough and believe companies like this don't deserve to stay in business. Based on their very poor rating it appears only a boycott would make Walmart change their policies and better train their staff.Date of experience:March 10, 2023",1

I have paid for Walmart+, it seemed like a good deal when I signed up and paid for a whole year.  I am handicapped and can't drive so I use it mainly for grocery delivery, or so I tried.  We have 3 stores in my area and I have tried all 3 and it makes no difference.  I get up early in the morning and make my order online.  I schedule for afternoon, several hours away.  It doesn't matter, every single time I get the same response ""We're sorry, your order is delayed, we will contact you when it's on the way"".  I go to therapy and doctor's appointments daily, I don't have time to wait around on Walmart deciding when to honor what I've paid for.  I end up paying Shipt or Instacart to get my groceries to me even though I've already paid Walmart to do this.  I will NOT make this mistake again.  I must add that when I complained about this Walmart sent me a $5.00 coupon to compensate for my trouble.  Considering Shipt costs me an extra $8.95 and Instacart is $9.95 Walmart can keep their lousy $5.00.  Another so called feature of Walmart+ is you're supposed to be able to order anything to be shipped with no minimum.  But if you compare the price of something you ask to be shipped to what it would cost you to purchase it in the store you will see there is quite a mark up on some items.  More than what it would cost you to have it shipped.This is an update.  I canceled my Walmart+ but they refuse to give a refund so I'm paid thru July 8th.  So like an idiot I placed another grocery order today, I placed the order at 7:30am.  I chose a Walmart Preferred time for delivery between 3 and 4 pm.  I figured this would give me plenty of time to get dinner ready.  Well guess what?  They're sorry but my order has been delayed.  It should arrive in a couple of hours, if it doesn't, please contact them.  They better believe I'm going to contact them.  And on top of that they put a hold on my bank account for more than twice the amount of my order.  They said it was to ensure there was enough money to cover weight differences and substitutions.  My order came to $70, they put a hold on my account for $140.  That's insane.Date of experience:March 05, 2023",1

There were 2 females worker named Judith and Merren. I am familiar with their rudeness, disrespectful, impolite, angry face, terrible attitude. They never greeted nor thanked the customers, always work unhappily, annoying. I always let it go and never really take it seriously and tried to tolerate them. But yesterday I no longer can keep it quiet. They were very rude, when I returned the online items, she asked me where is the bag with an angry tone. When I handed the bag, she said put the item into the bag. I think she doesn't know how to treat a customer with respect and doesn't know how to talk. Also they said some items I can't return it, when I asked them why she said I don't know. When Asked them to please call someone else or a supervisor maybe can help. They said I have to call Walmart.com. I knew the items is returnable bc I just bought it 2 weeks ago. After I was done returning all the items, I asked a female staff can I speak to a manager? she said Merren is the front manager, I said she is the problem. When I asked one of the female greeter if I can speak to a manager, she said I have to asked those 2 people at the CS who have the phone to call a manager. They're both the problem, how would they'll call the manager for me? Finally I called the Walmart CS online and I spoke to Fernando and he said will report it to a higher manager and I asked him also who is the manager in the store and he gave me a named. I found an assistant manager in the store and I told him about what happened. He said he'll speak to them and he apologized about what had happened. Walmart is a big store and with a good reputation. I'm just surprise why they have so terrible and horrible staffs at CS. I don't shop often at Walmart bc one of that reason and also the distance is far from my house. Why should I spend my money at the store who didn't provide a good CS? I'd like to go to a store shop and leave happily. I don't need that nasty, unprofessional, impolite attitude. It seemed like those 2 workers don't like their job and they annoy by customers. It was unacceptable. I hope the Walmart management read this reviews and reconsider if those 2 female workers are the right person for their position. I greatly appreciate Fernando and Clayton who spent their time to listen to me about my terrible experience. What I like about Walmart is their various items and their price.Date of experience:March 07, 2023",1

Apparently, she was looking at a handheld device and monitoring (supposedly) all six people simultaneously checking out at the various stations. She removed my card from the machine, then looked at the receipt and realized that yes, I had scanned everything, and had paid for every item. There was no real apology made, though she had wrongly insinuated that I was stealing in front of everyone who was waiting in line.After taking 15 steps, I was stopped at the door and asked to show my receipt. I handed over the receipt and didn't open my bag, and was allowed to leave the store. Walmart wants its customers to be its cashiers, yet feels the need to police our every move? No thanks. I'll be going to Target from now on.Date of experience:March 03, 2023",1

That I previously brought at that store. I purchase the bags Feb 26,2023. I was approach by an older African American lady at self check asking me to scan my bags. Which I responded back to her letting her know that my bags were already purchased which I had with me mixed up with my other bags I had brought into the store. Another worker came up to me and apologized for the other lady’s actions and behavior. Then she walked away but it didn’t stop there the older lady I asume was upset because the other worker apologized. She then went to the older man at the door to also make a scene to stop me before I left. I walked up to him I had no problem handing over my receipt to him. He looked at my receipt and ask did I pay for my bags I let him know I had already brought my bags and stated I was lying . I walked over to customer service where the young lady looked up my receipt and let him know yes I had purchased the bags they didn’t apologize or nothing they just kept talking like nothing ever happened.

This company says with it selling of certain Bissell vacuums that most of the funds go to pets. That is a bold face lie. Walmart will never donate any money to pets, even if it says on the box. Walmart is not in business to help anyone except themselves. Their service lines all lie, treat shoppers like crap and never adhere to their warranties. They don't support warranties and if they do, you can wait for up to 1 year for them to apply it. But they are very quick to take your payments and don't support their service obligations. All they do is make you wait until you have had enough of their lies and you stop bothering them. So, as far as Walmart goes, all Walmart does is lie, raise the prices on sale items or display expired foods. The EPA should be told so they can investigate the truth behind the lies. So don't trust Walmarts word with all these other ratings they have received. From an irate shopper.Date of experience:February 27, 2023",1

There is one exception & it's a major one because it involves a large expense. I suggest that no one  EVER ! buy a large appliance  from Walmart in particular if it involves purchasing an extended warranty. Walmart will not stand behind it. I contacted the better BBB in Bentonville. The result would seem to indicate that that particular BBB is powerless against Walmart. The issue is that despite the fact that their insurance policy clearly states that the coverage is instant, but in reality it does not go into effect until the mfg's warranty expires. Now you wait and see, sooner or later Walmart will change the wording regarding their extended warranty; but so far they have not!  So within 30-90 days you can return at Walmart . Up to 119 days you can make claim  through your bank; if purchased with a credit card. You can expect that the manufacturer of the appliance, in this case a water heater, will try to deny their warranty if you bought their product through Walmart. Furthermore should you get as far as trying to file a claim through the extended warranty program be prepared to do some detective work to find out which company undersigned it! Your problem! not theirs whether you have the  warranty or not. ANY excuse to not honor the extended warranty.In contrast you will find that if you , for example, buy an extended warranty on an appliance from Home Depot. IT IS CLEARLY STATED that the warranty is no good until the manufacturers warranty expires. I'll buy all sorts of things on-line from Walmart.

I ended up finding a few more things and picked up my kid's cookies and a pair of 54$ Sketchers and other food items I went through the checkout again and the lady started to say that the bag I had stuff from superstore was their stuff because it was Keurig things and shoes I said the shoes that are your are the sketchers I said the white ones says Joe on them a Superstore brand, she said we carry it too so I explained the story I even pulled out 6 other two week old Walmart receipts and showed her I had over 800$ on me why would I steal and that I wasn't a criminal I just couldn't find the receipt !! she was ripping through all 4 of my bags now humiliating me I was almost in tears, I would have started crying but everyone was looking so I just said I was here hours ago I am not missing my bus and waiting for you to go through your little cameras and I stand there embarrassed and ridiculed for something I didn't do I own my own local business I don't look like or am a thief so I gave her the bag she seem most certain that superstore stuff was theirs I gave it to them paid for my other stuff the second time I got from Walmart and had to show receipt for the first bag of Walmart stuff I bought and she went through item by itemI was a loyal customer they had NO right to treat me that way I lost over 120$ just to get out of there before I started crying I didn't even grab my 10$ change I just ran outside crying and got on my bus and went home without any of my things from superstoreDate of experience:February 21, 2023",1
Deena M,1review,AE,2023-02-22T06:15:56.000Z,"It's NeutralMy experience with Walmart is neutral. Many pros and cons. I've bought stuff from Walmart for years. I do most of my shopping in store verses online. Shopping in store is okay. Not really my favorite place to shop, but they offer the best prices for most of the stuff I buy in the area that I live in. Most locations I've been to (I travel a lot) have big and clean stores, which is nice. I also really like the self checkouts, though depending on the store, they are a pain to deal with because they constantly get an employee's attention to see if you are stealing. The main downside with my experience is that employees are either nice or just completely rude. Doesn't feel like an option to ask for help, honestly.Date of experience:February 20, 2023",3

Bethany Longmire,14K reviews,US,2023-02-21T22:07:57.000Z,"Ruined Christmas!On September 15, 2022, I placed an order for a Kid Kraft Modern Outdoor Swing Set. This purchase was to be a Christmas present for our children. It shipped in two boxes and arrived at our place on September 16, 2022. The boxes were placed into the garage, and we waited patiently for closer to Christmas to set up the swing set. On December 17, 2022, while my husband began to open the boxes and started the process of putting the swing set together, we noticed we received two boxes with the exact same parts. Two boxes of 1 of 2, we were missing box 2 of 2. We immediately got on the phone and called Walmart’s Customer Service. We had the pleasure of speaking with Najae, she promptly informed us there was an available box 2 of 2 for this order and we could replace one of the duplicated boxes for the box 2 of 2 and it would arrive no later than Monday December 26, 2022. We would just need to return one of the boxes 1 of 2 and Walmart would ship the replacement order for box 2 of 2. Again, this was a Christmas and she guaranteed we would receive the parts and be able to build the swing set. We explained to her that if we wouldn’t receive the box that we would send both boxes back and ask for a refund. On December 28, 2022, I received an email stating the return was received and Walmart would be refunding the money. For obvious reasons, we were upset that we did not receive box 2 of 2 as promised, and now the money was refunded to a card that is no longer active. After multiple phone calls and live chats to Customer Service from myself and my husband explaining the situation, no help has been received. We have a box with parts that we cannot use to build a swing set and after being told we needed to call our financial institution to receive the refund or that Walmart’s billing department would be contacting us for additional information, with no communication at all, it magically appeared into our bank account on January 25, 2023. I have requested a refund for the remaining order, and I am willing to mail back the box 1 of 2 at their cost. I have been unsuccessful at getting in touch with someone to send the refund for the second box. This has been highly frustrating and disappointing.Date of experience:December 17, 2022",1

I called within 3 minutes after receiving the text and what happened after is nothing less than criminal. It took 2 week, 4 live persons and 3 text agents to receive my refund. As a low income mother of 3, I had to borrow money to replace that grocery. I had to threaten to file a police report and also walk into the store undressed before they would refund me fully but only in bits and pieces because they CAN... $2 here, $50 there. Walmart is making it seems as if the items were delivered and I'm the problem trying to return it. A quick Google search shows this is a growing trend with Walmart delivery drivers. I received no apologies just total disregard and disrespect. If this has happened to me it's happened to thousands other people & Walmart is passing the blame..""we outsource our drivers""..I guess we have to wait for one of those drivers to commit a serious crime against a Caucasian person for Walmart to take notice. Or Perhaps if enough people tell their scam story.

Mandie Brougher,4reviews,US,2023-02-21T06:38:24.000Z,"Worst experience across the board.I placed an order on 2/18/23 to be delivered to my house, it was supposed to be delivered between 8-9pm that day & never showed up. The Walmart location refuses to answer their phones, so I called the Distribution center line. They apologized and said they would give me a 20% discount and a $15 promo code to use on the next order & that my order would be the 1st order delivered the next morning. So, after working all night, I waited for my delivery the next morning... which guess what... never showed up. My order was supposed to be there between 8-9pm & now at 11am I am on the line again with the distribution center and they told me that I have no other choice but to cancel my order because their system is experiencing a ""glitch"". I tried explaining to them that I spent the last of my money on these groceries for my kids to eat while I'm at work (I work nights in an ICU center) and that I couldn't wait for the money to be reimbursed to my account. They showed zero empathy and just told me I had to cancel the order.So, today (2/20/23) I got the reimbursement and placed the order again. (I lost the 20% discount when they cancelled my order, so I had to pay full price) and the only time I could select for delivery was 8-9pm, so I did. Again, 9pm rolls around, and no order. Again, the location I ordered my groceries from refused to answer (Monaca, Pa location) so I called the distribution center again. They told me that the driver was physically at the location getting my order at that exact moment, to please just wait ANOTHER 45 minutes and my order should be there. So, 10:30pm... still nothing. I called the distribution center again and they told me they assigned a new driver and hung up on me. It is now 11:30pm, I've been waiting 3 days for a delivery & I am again talking to customer service with ZERO resolution. I'm now being told that they will deliver it between 8-9am again. I asked if they could give me the 20% off discount they gave me on the first order that got cancelled, & the agent I'm speaking with now said no, refuses to let me speak to his supervisor and hung up on me.I cannot believe how awfully I've been treated by this establishment. They've treated me like me and my families business is worthless & that fulfilling orders that have been rightfully paid for doesn't matter to them. It's completely unethical. Why offer a service to your customers that you genuinely cannot provide to them? I feel completely ripped off and like the company feels like all it's customers are trash. I've NEVER been treated this badly & like I didn't matter by a company, or anyone, EVER. This is completely unacceptable. What good is a $15 promo code on my next order good for.... when anything I order NEVER shows up?!?!?!Date of experience:February 20, 2023",1

I checked their website to see the the garden center hours before I left my home. According to their website they close at 11pm. I arrived to the Walmart at 8:10 pm. Much to my surprise the garden center was closed. There were Walmart employees all around the store stocking items on shelves so I stopped and asked an employee why wasn't the garden center open and he said that they close at 8 and then he continued back to his job. So at that point I called the store phone number and hit the option for human support and no one answered the phone. So then I called back and hit the operator option and no one answered the phone. So I got back in my car and had to go home without a house plant for my mother in law for valentines day. What a huge disappointment that was. I know that if I were a Walmart employee I would have given better customer service than what I received. And it would also be very helpful if the correct store hours were available on their website.

I purchased a hoodie on the run headed to a funeral out of state. I didn't need the hoodie on the trip being it was warm. As I unpacked my suitcase and put hoodie on a hangar. I noticed small holes in the hoodie. I attended to exchange it for another. They refused to exchange it. So I will do my part to avoid shopping at Walmart and discourage my very large family and will try to remember this experience anytime Walmart comes into any conversation. The hoodie was only $19.98. Their service has become almost non-existent and I will probably cancel my $5000 Walmart card and shop as little as possible with Walmart.

At the time they were supposed to be delivered, I received a picture of my front porch with no items in it. So first issue is the driver stole my order.I immediately called and the rep looked at the pic and said she issued a refund. I waited a week and when there was no refund, I went into chat and asked what was going on. That person said it was issued but there was an error on their end so they had to escalate it to whoever so they can manually do it. I waited another two days. Mind you I got a refund from a seller off of Etsy, within one hour, on the same card.Ok so I go on chat and I ask this rep what the status of my refund is. He looks into it and then asks me if my card is still good or is it blocked. I told him it is still good, I just used it an hour before but for safety, I always lock it. He says they keep getting an error saying the card is blocked because I have it locked. Again, my Etsy refund posted while locked so that makes no sense. I unlocked the card and was told I have to wait another 7 days.It is ridiculous that they have not found honest drivers yet. I don’t care if they use Uber drivers or Spark or whoever, these people deliver wrong stuff and/or steal your entire order.Do not trust them when they say they have issued a refund.

Granite, every order has its substitutes/not available items, but to only get an email w/1 item that’s not in stock & you approve it…then you put your phone down for a few minutes….god forbid!Next thing I know, my order was delivered “prior to the time scheduled”, which is great, don’t get me wrong!!After receiving my order, there were so many substitutions that I did not approve.Most all produce was old, wilted and small in size. It also had so many substitutes w/o my authorization.Since then, I received the item today that was on the initial email stating it was out of stock. Low & behold, the box was heavily damaged:(.I will not eat a product that comes in a  damaged box, let alone “the product itself” was damaged as well.I did however learn a few things during this last delivery after contacting customer service. If you use Walmart Plus, as a customer you’re only asked to review “your driver”. I had no problems with the driver, unless he’s the one doing the shopping, but Walmart confirmed that an associate pulls the product, and the driver picks it ups and delivers.In addition, Walmart customer service made it right!! Refunded everything that was not up to par, as well as the items I didn’t approve for substitutes.Probably one of the best outcomes “as a consumer” vs customer service I’ve experienced.

It's not a review of any one particular moment but in general each time I visit this pathetic store. There's never product availability unless it's 60 miles away, search for products in local store offers no clear information it's always shady such as the price. It will say if purchase online but what's the price if I get it in store. There's never clear location availability as it will give a location  then say delivery to that location  and a date, always only 2 maybe 3 registers open besides the self check out which all check outs have extreme lines to wait in. The prices are at an all time high even though consumers end up doing the jobs of the employees such as scanning and bagging our purchases on top of that paying ridiculously high costs only to travel miles home and cut open produce to find it is perished or to open a boxed frozen product to find the plastic bag is wide open inside the box while the actual food has not been freshly sealed for who knows how long that what is to be for consumer consumption is fully exposed regardless if it is in the box. Walmart reveals prices will continue to rise due to theft and oh this is funny and because of employee pay rates rising which is far from believable since there are no cashiers during any period throughout the working hours also accusing consumers of theft when everything is locked up, perhaps it is NOT the consumers stealing from the stores . Many businesses close their doors due to employee theft as it very common causing bankruptcy. Even while raking in billions per month walmart shows its true colors regarding how much they value the consumers that shop and continuously get ripped off by paying alot for low quality products not to mention the decrease in amount of product for the same price or higher. Most employees are part time which means ineligible for benefits. Can corporate honestly justify high pay rates to employees? Produce for the past month looks as though it was found outback of another grocery store that had discarded it, mostly near perished only to last a day after getting it home. With the economy the way its been consumers cannot afford the fuel it would take to make trips to and from returning such items so they don't it just goes into the trash. Where's the value in that? Wait, where's the value in any purchases made at walmart? Many consumers simply overlook and disregard these discrepancies but when exactly will ENOUGH BE ENOUGH? How much more abuse do we as ""valued consumers"" have to endure before realizing that's it! Walmart needs us more than we need walmart!!! We make those greedy retailers get richer while we as ""valued consumers"" suffer low quality products for completely ridiculously high prices. Walmart claims they are closing stores due to theft, and who ate they accusing ? So while walmart belittles ,diminishes,insults and makes such assumptions about its much needed consumers, claiming customer satisfaction is their goal taking our money knowing how poor the quality is. Think about how many times you may have complained about something then think about how many resolutions occurred or if your complaint made any kind of difference. Can't think of any times walmart actually replied to resolve an issue you had? Actions speak much louder dont they? This is the daily operation of walmart and its sickening though we sit and do nothing allowing this retail giant to continuously take total advantage of us ""valued consumers"". Remember when this company first started  and remember the man who started this company what his reasons were for starting this company? That man had the American consumers at heart because it was what he believed in .we always hear things like "" give back to the community"" . Just keep in mind that an empire doesn't build itself, consumers are responsible for building that empire and as consumers we have the potential not to mention the power to reverse all of that, so very many consumers say the same thing about this retail giant, how much longer will we only make these comments and be taken advantage of? Something to consider is who needs who the most? Face it the products made in China that walmart sells don't last needing replacement within only a couple of years if that how is that a great value? Products that have safety hazards brought to corporates attention that gets ignored and the item is discarded or never used again, or minor incidences occur on their premises that you file a report as it too is ignored, still believe you are a ""valued consumer"" or that ""customer satisfaction"" is walmarts goal?

At the hospital, and MRI revealed an epidural hematoma and stenosis exacerbating the pain. When I was released from the hospital, I tried to get my prescriptions for pain from Walmart but, the arrogant pharmacist, Alicia Shaw, refused to dispense them. In fact, she said that she tore them up. which was one of her 3 lies. I had the hospital and my spine doctor call her but she still refused to fill them. As, a result, I had to make an emergency appointment with my physician to write all new prescriptions.They then took my old medicines which I will need after I heal fro this hematoma and destroyed them withoiut any offer to reimburse me.

cw,2reviews,US,2023-02-01T20:17:54.000Z,"Profit over ConsumerI am using this forum to share my recent experience with Walmart.com’s Marketplace venue. Anyone taking the time and querying the BBB will find that Walmart is basically insulated from any regulatory accountability and since the customer complaints are individual cases they can basically be put down.I want to direct consumer attention to the Marketplace venue at Walmart.com. An article at CNN Business, Walmart’s online store isn’t profitable. How it’s borrowing from Amazon’s playbook, dated 5/4/2021, highlights Walmart’s focus in the wild west of Internet commerce.“Walmart’s online business isn’t profitable, and it can make more money from third-party sales than from selling its own merchandise online. Not only does the company collect commission fees from sellers, it can then upsell merchants on even more products: ads, delivery services or even lines of credit through a partnership with Goldman Sachs.”A consumer has to question the “quality” of the review process for entry into the Marketplace. It is asserted “Walmart, sellers are subjected to a process that includes a review of the products they sell, their sales history and previous product and seller reviews.”My experience challenges this assumption. The presentation selling web pages are far from clear in presentation or content.My observation cannot be applied universally to Walmart.com Internet sales activities but draw attention to consumer risk exposure in the Marketplace. Walmart appears to have no interest in providing assurance that the 3rd party vendor web page and narrative is both accurate and credible.There are significant differences in the Marketplace Return and Refund policies/procedures.Per Walmart site:If your item is fulfilled by Walmart:If Walmart fulfills your Marketplace item, the seller keeps their inventory at Walmart fulfillment centers. Walmart will pick, pack, and ship the item(s) to you. From your Walmart account you can manage your order questions without having to contact the seller.•	Tracking•	Returns/Replacements•	RefundsContact the seller with questions about:•	Item specifications•	Technical support•	Any applicable warrantiesIf your item sold and shipped by a Marketplace seller:•	You receive the same secure checkout process and single payment that you have come to expect when shopping at Walmart.com.•	Contact the seller directly for any problem with your order•	If the seller doesn’t resolve your issue, Walmart Customer Care is available to help following the Walmart Marketplace Promise•	If you want to return an item sold and shipped by a Marketplace seller, most items are returnable to a Walmart store within 30 days without a box or shipping label. Please review the Marketplace Return Policy for more information.I tried returning to the local WM store based on web page comment re: returns within 30 days. This follows repeated attempts without success in reaching my Marketplace seller (sold & shipped by) through phone call and email. Store Customer Service stated not possible because it was purchased from 3rd party (sold & ship) and generated a 3”X3” register note that stated the customer “You can easily start your return on Walmart.com.” Wasted travel time and line wait time in excess of 1 hour.Return home and in an extended dialogue with on-line customer chat – frustrating at best.Order – WM stated could not return because it was not received. I advised this was incorrect and provided UPS Tracking # for the afternoon delivery.Return Process – advised could not initiate since order not delivered. I had to contact Marketplace seller. Advised all attempts failed. I was instructed to contact via web site.Message – I sent the vendor email through the system on 1/27/2023, date received, aborted store visit and on-line chat session.Reply email from Walmart - extract:We discovered a pricing error on some items in your order. We had to cancel them in accordance with our pricing policy.Don't worry - you weren't charged for these canceled items. Any temporary holds will be removed within 10 business days, in accordance with your bank's policy.What's next? We're working on correcting the issue on our end and updating the site. These items can be found in you purchase history if you'd like to place a new order.If you still have questions, you can learn more about cancelled orders. in our Help Center.I followed up in amazement trying to understand the WM time machine voiding a transaction that has been completed.WM did not want to address the vendor performance issue despite similar negative reviews.My issues and lack of review on offering, execution, delivery and communication was not addressed.It is interesting to note the same listing is in place at the same price!Date of experience:January 27, 2023",1

Donna,5reviews,US,2023-01-29T23:33:16.000Z,"Disappointed and ripped off.I am 69 years old and my husband will be 80 years old so we ordered a snowblower on line. We received it in Nov or Dec (I can't remember) but asked my son to put it in our garage until needed. We were getting snow this week so Tuesday I went to the garage to assemble it (chute, wheels and handle) after assembling I went to buy gas and oil so I would be prepared for the snow on Wednesday. I got it all set and it wouldn't start. After looking at it I saw a cable broken in the back. I called Walmart and the associate transferred me to higher level. After waiting 15 minutes on hold the lady answered and said since I have a warranty I need to contact Allstate. I called Allstate and after waiting was told I need to call Walmart. I told the girl I have a warranty and she said it doesn't cover the broken cable so call Walmart. I told her I will just return it. I went home and siphoned almost all the gas out. I took it to Walmart and struggled to get it in a cart as it was very heavy for me. I went to service desk and the manager came and said it has gas in it.I told him I got it out. He looked and since it was tilted in the cart it accumulated about a shot glass size of gas. He said get it out. I asked him how and he said leave it running. I told him it wouldn't start and that's why I am returning it. He said no gas in the store. I told him I shouldn't have to be lugging this snowblower back and forth at my age (hence the reason for ordering on line). He walked away from me. I started having chest pains so I had to wait for my son to come over to take it back. They gave the refund but the kicker is no refund on the warranty because it is over 30 days so I paid 450.00 and my refund is 416.00. Never, Never again. From now on I go to home Depot or Menards.

Act with integrity? Respect for the individual? Walmart is more like low paid actors pretending to be there to service the community and make a profit on selling groceries. I worked for the company for 7 years. I worked in a dozen different locations- remodeled stores- and I have been in management roles most of that time. In that time I have seen Walmart in and out and they have a lot to hide. I was told to get my white a** outside for asking an hourly team lead where to put freight and when he became hostile I called my manager and did the proper procedure to handle the situation. I was told I could forget about it or go to another store and then terminated for speaking up. Since this incident the APASM has fled to another store to stay under the radar and Walmart never reached out to see if I was okay. Since then I’ve been in and out the hospital and I have suffered a heart attack. This company lacks the empathy to have associates when the only drive is to raise wages and bully the associates and if an associate raises a care or concern they are terminated.

Entering the store is often depressing because staff avoid helping customers. I had to work late…needed groceries and decided to give them another try. On 1-17-2023 the produce area was actually filthy! I needed only 7 items….and no one was available to help me find anything. There were only 2 human checkers…and when I got in line to check out, an attempt was made to shuffle me to self check out. The employee was rude… I am 71, and have a bad ankle. I left the merchandise in the cart and informed them I’d shop else where. Unless all customers want to experience a future terrible experience and fewer shopping choices…I suggest NOT shopping here. This company made record profit during the pandemic….making shopping processes more difficult. It is interesting that even their review process discourages comments related to the terrible customer service that is now embraced by this company! Customers are expected to become workers in poorly stocked and maintained warehouse environment. If you need to use a restroom…heaven help you as you sprint across the store…and they have a 50% chance of being closed.

I purchased $103.×× of goods thru self check out. I inserted a $100 bill then went to insert a $50. When I pulled out the $50 a $100 was stuck to it. When I inserted both bills it pulled one an inch or so and then the other. It happened so fast I wasn't able to grab the bills. The funny thing was the screen at the self check out showed i put in $150 but it fave me change as I put in $200. I had actually put in $250. I knew exactly how much monet I had as I was paid $200 from person just 10 minutes before I got to the store and $150 from another at the store. I called it to the attention of the person working the self check out but she didn't seem to understand. I explained to a manager what had happened he opend the cash box. He really didn't count the money or check too much but it show an error had occured. I showed him when I add the purchase I made to the money in my pocket I was $50 short. He was confused a little because he tried twice to give me $100 back. I was honest and told him NO. Just $50. That made the total of mu purchase and monet in my pocket total $350 which was what I had.

I wouldn’t even leave one starI wouldn’t even leave one star.I made a purchase online which was delivered by the store in Greeneville TN to my home. The delivery was over 8 hours late to start with. I decided to return the item. $33.04 was used on a Walmart Gift Card and the rest was purchased using my debit card. I started the return online and when I went to the store to return it with the receipt barcode, the employee told me the whole amount would be placed on a Walmart giftcard. Which is absurd. Walmart’s own return policy clearly states original form of payment is refunded with the receipt. It was well within the 30 days as I had until the 31st of January which the app clearly shown. My attempt to return was the 26th of January. I go online to chat with a representative explaining this and they told me refunds did go on original payments but supposedly my order was already refunded and they refused payment back to me. Apparently, they do not like accountability and I got an email stating my online account was closed. That’s very retaliatory when I did nothing wrong yet they did and when caught decided I’d just go away if they deleted the account. But, per the email, I can shop in store as often as I like.??? I have a right to speak and I stated facts like the fact I would file with the FTC and several other agencies. Walmart is no dictatorship nor can they just decide to give me a gift card so I won’t spend my money elsewhere. They broke their own return policy. And, they imply fraud from me when I actually follow their policy and try and create a return with receipt legally…that’s an insult to my character and totally unfounded bias because I called them out on corruption, fraud and illegal practices. Now their CEO talked about closing stores due to theft problems in December 2022. But, what’s the difference between that and Walmart making millions from fraud schemes with their money centers stealing millions from people using that service. The FTC has sued them just due fraud!!!

We arrived early and checked in and went shopping in the store after being told it would take less than an hour, no problem.  After 30 minutes we were called back to the counter and told that they did not have the right socket for the nuts on the wheel.  They did have a 13mm and a 15mm but not the 14mm needed.  To help and expedite the problem, they couldn’t change the tires otherwise, I offered to drive do the nearest AutoParts store and buy them a 14mm socket.  When I came back and presented the socket, I was told they were only allowed to use Walmart approved sockets, and could not use the one I had handed them.  Brilliant, I asked them why they did not tell me this before I left, they replied that they were going to. When? After they had buzzed the door out, maybe?  At this point I headed for the Customer Service desk and asked for the Store Manager who I was told was “not in today”.  In the end I had to explain my story three times to hourly staff who were ‘very sorry’.  The last one said he would look for “a salaried member of staff” and left me waiting for half an hour.  I called the main Walmart Customer Service number and was put through to a very pleasant lady who took all my details and then I told my story once again.  She told me that there was ALWAYS a manager on hand at all stores during business hours and promised to escalate the problem and I would be contacted with a resolution promptly.  In the meantime the Tire department ‘manager’ had found the missing 14mm socket and the tires got changed. He made a big deal of taking off the tire protection package which we had already said we didn’t want.  We eventually left the store after over 2 hours. This was some five days ago and there has been no contact.

If the vender doesn’t want to refund, I am guessing, I will have to wait until the product actually arrives. This is a very bad way to do business, says me. Items should be guaranteed a full return. Walmart should stand behind the products that are being sold in their name.Date of experience:January 24, 2023",2

They did not seem to have clear understanding on how it is done, but just told me to “Scan in” from the outside of the store and someone will help me.  I went around the store twice to look for a place where I can scan in for pick up.  Finally, I figured out about online order parking spot and call the number on the sign to check-in.

Heartless.I am a poor person who used a gift card from a church to buy food. I had recently moved and forgot about the address online and did not change it in timeI had placed an order online using the gift card and the Instacart lady had dropped the food off at the wrong address. She had called me once but I missed her phone call. When I called her back she said she had left the food at the other address and that the problem was mine and I had to deal with it. because I had placed my order through Walmart and not through Instacart. So I tried to call Walmart and ask if I could get a refund because it was a mistake and I did not receive my order. The order was for $140 and like I said it was from a gift card given to us from a church for Christmas cheer.since we needed the food I had to make the same order again and it clearly shows on my file that I made the exact same order on the same day but two different addresses. The first one being the incorrect address and the food that I lost and the second one being the proper address and the extra money I had to spend.Walmart did not hold up their end of the deal and refund our money they simply  ignored Me. I even called representatives and made a report and they told me they would  get back to me within 24 to 72 hours this was  almost a month ago nowI am disgusted and appalled that they would not even give us a voucher or let us get the money back.our family went without for Christmas/ new years for food because of them and their non-hospitality.

One exception was with an order that the Walmart website failed to inform me would be delivered from a local store. After experiencing a problem, local delivery is magically no longer available to my address. Problem solved. Unfortunately, the latest issue I've had seems to be intractable. Cans of food that I order are consistently damaged. These are very strong steel cans, that are not damaged easily. The damage has occurred with orders shipped from multiple Walmart distribution centers, so this is a systemic problem. Replacement items even arrive severely damaged, well-packed in undamaged shipping boxes. Walmart keeps doing the same thing over and over, while expecting a different result. If Walmart would just offer canned food by the case, this problem would not occur. When I order this same product from a competitor that sells it by the case, it is never damaged. Unfortunately, the competitor didn't have it in stock the last time I needed it, so I had to order it from Walmart. It's hard to believe that no manager at any level in the company will take ownership of this issue and solve it.Date of experience:January 18, 2023",3

Horrible customer service.On 12/20/2022 I ordered a MOOER RED TRUCK Combined Guitar Multi-Effect Pedal Processsor Overdrive Distortion Reverb WAY01.  I was charged a total of $281. plus some change for the item.  I ordered it for a Christmas gift but was advised it wouldn't be delivered until 01/12/2023.  I waited patiently although my son needs the item asap and my money is in Walmarts hands.  On 01/09/2023 I received notice that the item with the tracking number was delivered to our mailbox.  We were concerned because we didn't believe the time would fit in the mailbox.  When we retrieved the item it was a torn envelope the size of the shipping label with a tiny emory board inside.  I immediately contacted Walmart Customer Service and demanded my money back so my son could get what he needed and had been waiting on since Christmas by purchasing something locally.  I got the runaround and after about 1 1/2 hours I requested to speak to a supervisor.  After another 30 minutes on the phone I got an apology, a $25 gift card and a promise that I would be able to get a refund on Saturday the 14th because there was a window and because the delivery date fell between 01/09 and 01/12/2023 and because Walmart rules said I had to wait two additional days I would need to call on Saturday.  I waited one additional day and called today, Sunday, 01/15/2023.  Once again I got nothing but a runaround waiting considerably more time after two additional calls and a bunch of research.  The first person on todays call promised me a refund but said I'd have to wait 24-48 hours for the funds to be refunded.  (I'm sure Walmart prefers for the money to be in their account as long as possible rather than mine).  I asked for a confirmation and she said I'd get an email advising me of what she had stated.  I checked for the email and what it said was they were investigating where the item was and contacting the seller and I would hear from the seller in a couple of days.  So what she said was a lie.  I made actually two more calls because the first one just sat there, finally after the initial conversation I had to ask for another supervisor.  He was completely uncooperative and said I had to return the item first before I could get a refund. I said I wouldn't waste my time returning a one inch emory board, if I received the item and wanted my money back of course I would return it but not this total insult of a package.  I did offer to provide a photo of the label and item.  I also advised I was already promised a refund immediately and I believe they would have taken notes as all businesses I know take notes regarding calls.  He continued to insist he wouldn't give me a refund without returning the junk I received in spite of the promise previously made by a supervisor.  I would highly recommend that noone do business with Walmart in light of their horrible customer service, dishonest promises and crappy vendors.  I looked up the vendor and they had terrible reviews and I could only find reviews about clothing items, nothing musical or electronic.

The reason I chose to have it delivered was so I didn't have to drive 10 miles to get it and go through the hassle of parking, finding it and the other items I wanted in the store, checking out with clerks who are not paid to be nice to customers, and then lugging it home.  It was delivered today.  The trash can is the correct one, but the lid is not for that trash can.  I ordered a step-on trash can and the lid I received is for a swing trash can, which will not work. Whoever picked it up at the store didn't bother to see if the can and lid matched.  SO I have now tried to talk to two ""customer service"" reps, neither or whom have English as their first language and were extremely difficult to understand.  I wanted it to be picked up and the correct unit delivered.  That is not too much to ask for the carelessness of some Walmart employee.  Unfortunately, neither of these unhelpful ""customer service"" people were able to provide me with a label so it could be picked up.  So now I have to load the trash can in my car and drive about 8 miles in the other direction to the UPS store where they can scan the code.  To say that I am not happy about this experience is an understatement.  Customer service has never been a major part of Walmart's philosophy, and it seems rather non-existent now.

I have on both occasions told them I did not authorize it and they refused to immediately cancel the charge. On the first occasion I had to contact customer service every day for 2 weeks to get my money back and now it's the same problem with this 2nd time. Walmart is stealing money from people and signing them up for stuff they do not want or authorize. I will not tolerate it and I am pursuing further actions against Walmart for fraudulently taking money from my bank account. Customer service is rude, hateful and has no knowledge or willingness to do their job. They refused to allow me to speak with a supervisor or upper management and hung up me when I asked for higher authority assistance.Date of experience:January 13, 2023",1

I finally found out that it was shipped elsewhere. Then I find out they couldn't help me and told me to contact the manufacture, UPS and directly and dispute my purchase with the credit card company. Wow, talk about standing behind your business. So, basically Walmart only takes the order and your payment but when things go wrong.....there job is done. This is what is wrong with this country!!

Eric McClard,30reviews,US,2023-01-13T16:25:22.000Z,"DO NOT GET YOUR OIL CHANGED AT POULSBO WALMARTI went to the Walmart auto center in Poulsbo, WA to get my oil changed. My car was completed and given back to me “ready to go”. When I started the car there was a red triangle on my dash, which on Toyotas this means something REALLY BAD is happening. I immediately returned inside the store and told them what was going on. They scrambled to find a manager. I went outside to get the oil techs. They drove my car back into the bay. At this time there is an obvious oil slick trail from bay to parking spot, in the spot, then back to the bay following my car. Chris the oil tech who drove my car out said he noticed the red triangle when driving it out.I’m not a mechanic, but I’m smart enough to know when there’s a red triangle, the car SHOULD NOT be driven. Instead of heeding that warning, Chris drove it out, and turned the car over to me as if it was finished.I proceeded to listen to Eric the actual tech who worked on my car, inspect my car from underneath. Eric yelled out “F$@&!!!! Go get 2 managers!!!” Eric came out from underneath the car. I asked him what they did wrong. Eric told me “they drove my car out of the bay, without putting an oil filter on. That’s why I told them to get 2 managers”At this point I’m livid over the potential destruction of my engine, caused by the skilled technicians at Poulsbo Walmart. A manager named Raef I believe, came and said they “fixed the problem” but refused to give me a written statement of the events, in case of future issues caused by their mistake. At that point I asked for another manager. I also called 1 800 Walmart.Jeff the manager came up. I asked if he was there to talk to me, which he said yes. I told him I was in the phone with Walmart, he responded with “what are they going to do for you” no apology, just a assurance that he WAS NOT going to give me a statement saying what I was asking. I understand now that a “claim” is Walmart policy, but instead of coming at me with an attitude and telling what you’re NOT going to do, you could have apologized first and foremost. Your employees almost potentially caused significant damage to my vehicle. I drive for Ubereats, almost 1000 miles a week. My car is EVERYTHING to me. You and your technicians almost destroyed it, and I’m getting attitude lol?I was a restaurant manager for over 15 years, and I completely know how to handle an employee’s mistake. Jeff couldn’t have handled it more poorly. Walmart of Poulsbo needs to retrain their management, and they’re oil technicians. This whole entire situation, shows their lack of simple understanding of how to do their jobs.Oil tech forgets filter, and drives car with big red triangle on dash, and managers forgets that apologies go further than attitude.I will never get my oil changed at Poulsbo Walmart again. I will also be sure to tell EVERYONE that will listen in kitsap county, why they should NEVER get their oil changed there as well. I may shop there again, because convenience is inevitably going to bring me in again.DO BETTER WALMARTDate of experience:January 12, 2023",1

Apparently Walmart doesn't do that any more. You go to Target and they match their website. Let's be real here. Target will price match Amazon! Petco and PetSmart also match their own website. So let me ask the question Walmart. How long are you going to keep up the malarkey? Truthfully, people only have to come there for a few things now that Amazon is running the game! Fix the issue and start matching your own website again! The end!Date of experience:December 23, 2022",1

This third party seller stole a branded listing and fooled and misled all under Walmarts watch. I received a knockoff and fake item. Not what I was supposed to be receiving. This is deceitful and fooling. Walmart allowed this to happen and did not remove this seller or product page. Walmart customer service offered me at first $10 then$15 then $20 then $25. I told them this was insane it’s not about their $25 promo codes. It’s about the product I ordered and should have received what is fair. They obviously did not care. Why would I want their promo code do they really think I would shop them again ? Very confused. I am appalled and never had this happen on Amazon which I use more than once a day.

The Manager as I understand it, has had some serious health concerns. He's not there on most days.  When he's out, nobody is in charge and whomever is there looks for ways out of work rather than accomplishing anything at all.  I use to go to this location for oil changes and had descent luck.  Not lately.  I had an oil change on my vehicle and they stripped the oil pan threads and I had to take it to another repair shop for corrective action.  Thankfully WM paid the bill to a tune of about $500 for a new oil pan.  Recently, I decided to give them another chance.  I drove my vehicle in for an oil change and was promptly advised that they are not doing oil changes at this time due to a shortage of trained technicians.  About a month later I went back with a different vehicle.  No vehicles were in any of the bays.  Was told the crew was going to lunch -- come back in an hour.  The tech writer was basically a joke and was once a decent technician but all he does now is write up the orders.  Also, you can rarely get anyone to run the cash register in Auto.  WM needs to seriously consider shutting down this Auto Service.  It's the absolute worst excuse I've ever seen for any Auto repair.

When you get the right link to have someone call you back (usually an hour later), they are difficult to understand and offer plenty of apologies, but NEVER resolve your problem.4-Sure, they offer “up to” 10¢ off a gallon of gas, but until you get to the pump you never know how much or even IF there is a discount.  THEN, to get the discount you have to go through multiple steps on the app, wait for them to send you a code to enter at the pump — all prior to paying as you normally would, and if the cell service isn’t that great in the area … DON’T EVEN.5-Free shipping with no minimum USED to be the ONLY benefit, but no longer.  Items are increasingly “not available for shipping” or much higher than in-store pricing.  Same-day shipping is NON-EXISTENT.6-Paramount Plus is hardly worth the $100 you dish out for the service.  No, thanks!7-Walmart pickup, although flawed at best, is the best service they offer and it’s FREE for everyone with a $35 minimum order (same as Walmart+).Date of experience:December 22, 2022",1

It was delivered to the wrong address which is approximately 50 miles from my house.  I contacted Walmart and they said this incorrect address is on my account.  When I placed the order my correct address for billing and shipping were on my account.  Somehow this address I never heard of has been placed on my account.   I live alone so nobody in my household could have added the address.  Walmart refused to help me, nor could they give me information as to when the address was changed and referred me to fight the charge through my credit card company.  Apparently, my account was breached and probably by someone who works there.Date of experience:December 22, 2022",1

autumn lovelace,1review,US,2022-12-24T05:54:47.000Z,"Fed up with Walmart at this pointFed up with Walmart at this point. I ordered items online as Christmas presents for delivery since the Walmart in my area is like going to a Zoo. I ordered eight items total and paid round ten dollars to have it delivered the next day. I was charged right away for everything as well as a hold on my account. The next day comes and when I was expecting my delivery to arrive I get notified that all eight of my items I ordered were out of stock! And they all were different brand items that said in stock online! It let me order them all and charged my card for all eight items plus delivery! Well 4 could be shipped within the next two days which I was fine with... But it has been 5 days, and I never received my refund for the other 4 items that were out of stock and since all my items were canceled I never had a delivery at all but was charged the delivery fee and it's still not been returned. It would be nice if they checked to see if the items were available BEFORE they charge your card. Because for people who live paycheck to paycheck that may have been buying items they need and get screwed out of the money they spent on nothing and when you speak to customer service they say it can take up to ten days to get your money back.

Ordered an item for pickup the next day a few days ago, then was told late that night it would be unavailable for pickup and instead delivered the next day. 3 days later no delivery, I check the order and it says delayed (no notification). I contacted customer support and they said  if I found it at another Walmart they could cancel the order (would have been nice if they helped me find it). I found at a different Walmart store and contacted them and was told my online order was canceled and I would be refunded. The next morning I received notice that my order was to be delivered after Christmas. I called and was told I somehow had two orders (I only ordered one item…) and one was canceled and the service rep failed to cancel my other order. Then was told to call fedex to have them help cancel the order.. I called fedex and they said they needed Walmart to request the order be canceled first (which I was told was already done, but I guess was not). I called back and was finally told I would have to wait for my item to come in, call back again, and then initiate a return process at the store. So many false promises and lies throughout the whole process. This will undoubtedly be the last time I shop online at Walmart.

Tonya Adams,2reviews,US,2022-12-23T04:18:44.000Z,"Lied to by Walmart chat rep, now 4yr old has nothing for Christmas!So by this point in life I don’t expect much from Walmart, but I didn’t expect to be lied to, in writing after multiple issues with their online ordering. Now a 4yr old in Georgia has no Christmas, and surprise, Walmart doesn’t care!A little backstory, one of my friends back home from high school shamefully made a plea on Facebook for help getting her 4 year old Christmas. She also has a 17 yr old who said not to worry about him he understands and just wants his little brother to have something under the tree for Christmas cause it means more to him. Well I started with a general search for hot wheels racetracks, that led me to Walmart having a Jurassic World themed racetrack for a reasonable price that also allowed us to afford a present for the oldest as well. So I placed the order on Dec 19, their banner in yellow at the top of their website said if it was ordered by Dec 21, it would arrive in time for Christmas. So after placing the order I’m told the racetrack would be delivered the following day and the shirts for the 17 yr old on Wednesday. On Tuesday at midnight we were notified that the delivery was delayed and by Wednesday there was still no update.  So I went to chat who basically said that they could do nothing and agreed the best course of action was to cancel the order and reorder it for pickup. So we cancelled the delivery and reordered it for pickup. We were told it would be ready by 4:11pm and shortly after this time, we were told it was unavailable at a store that has enough stock per their website. So we were notified it could be shipped and arrive by Dec 29, which does nothing to get a 4 yr old at least 1 present for Christmas morning. So I went to chat. I also should have learned at this point but thought maybe they’d have some better options. I got the luck of chatting with Lavone. I explained the situation and how this gift was the only gift a 4 year old in Georgia would get, and asked about other options for getting this toy. Lavone empathized saying he had experienced Christmas with no gifts and how he assured me that if I allowed him to change it to delivery, it would be delivered despite the website estimating Dec 29. So I reluctantly agreed to let him set it for shipping. Fast forward to today, Dec 22, and this delivery was still preparing. I reach out to chat support to see what is going on and this time I speak with Miguel. Miguel had the duty of telling me that Lavone had lied and that this gift wouldn’t be delivered until after Christmas on Dec 29. So I asked what Walmart was going to do, after all had Lavone been truthful, I could have still had time to order a gift from somewhere else and now, 3 days before Christmas my options were very limited if any for making sure this kid had at least one gift on Christmas morning from Santa. But they didn’t extend me that favor and then Miguel basically said that he’d ensure Lavone was not allowed to work on the platform again but there was nothing they could do to help me get a gift to a 4yr old. A suggestion was for me to go to the store and buy it myself, this is after I told him I lived in Colorado and this gift was bought for someone in Georgia. So I was upset and asked for a manager, and I got the luck of Karl who was also less than helpful. He also refused to do anything to help beyond escalate the issue and have Lavone fired for lying to me. Walmart is to blame for a 4yr old not having a gift on Christmas morning and they don’t care. They have lost my business for good. The only way they will get the hint, is for enough of us to stop shopping there. They’ve let me down for the last time.Adding insult to injury, I went to their Facebook page to try and get some help. I posted the issue in the comments section of their last minute Christmas gift post. I was responded to and given a link to speaking to someone further. It was a Facebook messenger link that was a general contact form. I went through the form and listed my issue along with screenshots of the issues starting with the first delivery that never showed up, the pickup order that was available and then became unavailable, and all the chats I had with the agents. I was again told that it would be escalated but given no actual help. This entire thing has made me rethink what saving a few dollars means in relation to service and my sanity.Date of experience:December 22, 2022",1

Contacted DHL delivery Co. I was told the tracking # belonged to another order and delivered Dec 7 in Ont. I live in SK. Called customer service again Dec 16 when no email was received. Was told escalation dept would call me 48-72 hrs maybe 1-2 more days. Was not guaranteed a refund or new order with new shipping. Still waiting for phone call, not holding my breath for the call or refund or the item. So if the seller above is the same, for an item you are interested in THINK 2,3,4 TIMES BEFORE ORDERING. I agree Amazon has absolutely nothing to worry about with walmart online ordering as competition. What kills me is a multi million dollar company like Walmart having no problem doing business with these sellers. It's like they don't care how it affects their online ordering business. I wrote a review about this on Facebook. I got an email saying they wouldn't post my review. Which just added salt to the wound. The email received was a no reply email.

It didn't work. I tried to return it, but Walmart.com said a ""third-party seller"" (Rainbean LLC) had actually sold it to me and that I must get my refund through Rainbean. Note, Rainbean's address is in Shanghai, China, they only have a Chinese phone number listed online and no email address; if you go to their website and try to ""contact"" them, it redirects you to Walmart.com's page for Rainbean.With no other option available, I hit ""Contact Seller"" on Walmart.com, and left a message that I wanted to return Order Number 2000101-06043845. A few hours later I received an email from ""no-reply@@relay.walmart.com"" that explained to me that Rainbean would respond within 48-hours. (Note, this is all within the 30-day return window as posted on the webpage for the exact item I was trying to return).But Rainbean never responded to that communication I made through Walmart.com.I then created a dispute with my credit card to work the refund that way, but after a couple months Rainbean responded to them and showed the original purchase receipt, shipping/deliver proof, but they made no mention about my attempts to communicate with them.  So my credit card company's bank couldn't recover from 3P seller's bank because I didn't have a refund slip. (how can I get a refund slip if merchant won't even respond to my communications and exists on the other side of the planet?)I trusted Walmart.com, they outsourced the sale, the purchased item is far inferior than how it was marketed, and I have no ability to refund despite their posted refund policy. Super regret that I went to Walmart for this.Rainbean LLC is the 3P seller. Strongly recommend not buying from them if you may need to make a return; don't trust that they'll honor their refund policy.UPDATE 12/23/2022: I spent an hour on phone with Walmart.com to try and explain Rainbean LLC's failure to communicate about my refund request. The supervisor with the Walmart customer service team couldn't even pull up my communication to Rainbean through Walmart.com (despite them sending me an email from no-reply@@relay.walmart.com (that Reference ID number is B4E981745A36432582C631117B8B1F18). What really frustrated me is that, despite Walmart sending me that email their customer service supervisor cannot pull it up/recognize it on his end. I'm literally looking at it and offering to email it to them or share my screen so they can see it, but supervisor is saying he doesn't need it because his system isn't showing it. He even wouldn't let me read that reference ID (B4E981745A36432582C631117B8B1F18) to confirm I did make the communication within the 30-day return window.So there was no way to return the product at a local Walmart store, nor directly to Walmart.com, and the third-party seller wouldn't respond to my communications through Walmart.com, and there was no other way to communicate with the third-party seller had no other way for a US customer to contact them. Nicely done..I am very frustrated because now it all seems that WALMART.COM either —(a) negligently or knowingly allows third-party vendors to post arbitrary refund policies that they don't honor on their Walmart.com postings and who don't provide a meaningful way to US based consumers to contact them directly (again, they only provide a Chinese phone number; no email address available so forget about getting a time-stamped email sent out directly).and/or(b) fails to provide a functional means of communicating to their third-party sellers via Walmart.com's consumer interface, and fails to keep retrievable records of all communications that consumers make.I am not a fan of Amazon but they are WAY better at refunds, which is a critical component to online shopping. It's fine if a seller doesn't offer refunds and clearly states it on their webpage selling an item, but to not honor the return policy you post is deceptive trade practice. I wouldn't have minded paying a restocking fee and even return-shipping if they demanded it. But no communications were made to me at all except for Walmart's email saying the seller would contact me back within 48 hours several months ago.Not happy at all with Walmart.com and Rainbean LLC. My overall feeling from this is that I've been deceived and exhausted from the run-around and meaningless words from Walmart Customer Service.Date of experience:August 28, 2022",1

We've given them chance after chance after chance to make up for all of their faults, and tonight is the straw that broke the camel's back.In the past, we've had the following issues: Late delivery, cancelled without notification, 24 hour delay, rotten vegetables, rotten fruit, melted and re-frozen ice cream, fully melted ice cream, thawed out frozen meals, sliced ham when whole ham was ordered, whole turkey when sliced turkey was ordered, SOMEONE ELSE'S DELIVERY dropped on my doorstep while my order was taken somewhere else, bizarre substitutes unrelated to the item ordered, the list goes on.Whenever we called to question or complain, the woman who answers the phone (same voice every time) was rude and unprofessional. All we ever got for our troubles was a ""whoops, here's $5-$20 off your next order"".Tonight, I put in a delivery order at 1 pm, and the app told me it would arrive at 6pm. At 6:40, I was informed the delivery would be 2 hours late. At 8:30pm, I called to ask where my dinner was, and the staff let the phone ring for a full 5 minutes before their machine hung up on me. I called back, got transferred to their delivery department, and the delivery department ALSO let their phone ring ceaselessly for over 6 minutes before I finally hung up. I tried to call back, and nobody answered. Relative called and was told there were no drivers because the snow was ""so bad"". I can still see the yellow lines on the road, so it's not even a quarter of an inch thick.Apparently, they switched delivery services last month, to a company that doesn't even have drivers in our area! I'm disabled and can't drive to the store, so how am I supposed to get any of my essentials if their drivers are scared of a thin layer of snow?Completely incompetent, it's a miracle they're still in business.Date of experience:December 19, 2022",1

I explained I'm on a fixed income, and the bank shows they were paid already, and by taking it twice, they were holding up the money from my account that I needed. The rep's response was to wait seven business days for it to clear from the bank. I explained the hardship that would cause, to which he responded ""to bad"", wait the seven days, and disconnected the chat. I can understand them taking the payment, but twice?

I decided to go and check in tire dep. for the tires, only 1 of 8 was sold right at the store, the others only online purchase, but doesn't tell or it isn't clear on the website.Right at the counter I hear that there's just one tire left of the make and model I wanted. I complained that checking thru walmarts' website is misleading and a waste of time. I was suggested to go and check to another store which is time consuming and I cannot believe I ask if they can check for availability the other store BUT ""the system"" is NOT shared between stores, weird enough, and cannot check on the computer neither make a call.Very poor and disappointing. Finally I got to the other store and another fiasco, there where only 3 tires left. To add insult to the injury some employees are rude. Furthermore the waiting time can take really long, and the waiting area, well at this location actually there was just a filthy metal bench on a narrow  side of the tire racks area, almost over your head, and a customer's line so close you'd have to watch out for your feet.

Store 01560 Address 6005 S Eastern Ave, Las Vegas, NV.Walmart seems to be the ONLY grocery store chain that sells molded, and spoiled fruit.This isn't my first time with bad fruit, this is SIMPLY MY LAST.  Not only are these blackberries spoiled they have caused issues with my stomach right now.Not to long ago Walmart sold me Carmel Apples.I ate one on my way home and when I got there my stomach was already tore up.  I later saw mold on the the other two so I am sure mine had mold on it as well.  This was sold by a company that does not check their fruit.  I am honestly disgusted and next time I will order my food and it will be from AMAZON FRESH.  Always fresh fruit.SPOILED FRUIT ""Black Berries"". 2 packs.   They will make you GAG BY THE TASTE.GAG!!!This is my last time buying fruit from Walmart.  Also due to the behavior and push back received by Venice the Supervisor and Catherine the customer service associate, I will never shop at that store anymore!  They have completely lost my business...I also have one Morning Side Chicken nuggets that I purchased and it was cut, meaning it was open.  It appeared to be a fine cut like it was cut with a BOX CUTTER during the unpacking.  That happens sometimes but each and every time it happens customers deserve a refund.I was denied my refund for that as well and I am not going away quietly.I want my refund and I will get it.1. SELLING SPOILED FOOD IS A CRIME at least I think so.  It is against the Health Dept., OSHA and FDA?Selling food that can make customers sick.Is unethical and can get you sued.CFPB takes complaints to build a CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT.They will get mine to add to their list.There's a lot of health issues related to eating food with growing bacteria.2. Contaminated chicken is chicken that was open and exposed prior to purchasing.We're still in a Pandemic no matter how many unstable people believe it to be over.So to hear NO REFUNDS AND NO EXHCHANGE MAKES MY DAY.  Because what I am sick of is poor customer service.  And carelessness that shows the customers that WE ARE NOT VALUED...I will be filing complaints until my refund is received.So yes I did waste gas going back to walmart.Both Catherine an Venise were unhelpful They both said they do not exchange fruit or food in general any more.  That makes this borderline Fraudulent.  I was sold items under FALSE PRETENSES.The problem is, if you are selling OUTDATED FRUIT THAT IS AGAINST PLENTY OF RULES.They will be fined if the Health Dept is contacted and discovers most of their fruit is outdated by date and already spoiling!  I am filing a complaint.If you are selling spoiled food to avoid shortage or loss, these complaints that I am about to file should make them rethink that new rule of selling outdated and spoiled food.Refusing to refund it only makes maters MUCH WORSE.I am not walking away from this.After being denied a refund I called customer service 1800 WALMART to report their behavior and refusal to assist me.I now have a reference number to the call and attaching it to my BBB, CFPB and Health Dept complaints.I also requested for the store manager to call me.If he/she doesn't call I will get my refund from NFCU.I was cheated into buying spoiled and contaminated food and then denied MY REFUND.

The item was thrown on the porch. It was raining and the item is soaked. The driver could have put the item between the screen door and it would have been protected from the weather. In the FedEx tracking it states the item was given to the customer. No one was home in either unit at the time of delivery. I am very upset as the driver was just lazy, lied and the item is soaking wet.Date of experience:December 14, 2022",1

First I contacted most of what I would consider reputable shops, they were all booked. I won't go to any Monkey, Jiffy or Bucky types of places based on my past experiences. In determination to reach my objective, I went to Wallyworld! I hate that I did this but it has to be done. I parked my truck, went inside and was told to pull up to the bay. There was one car inside and I was the next in line. Moments later I was greeted by a ""tech"". I told him that I'd like to get my oil changed. He said ""we can't"". I asked why and he told me there are only two of us, and we're going to lunch now.

Spending thousands of dollars every year.  I really hope an exec of Walmart reads our feedback!Long story short, I purchased a cell phone in electronics, requesting that I continue my Straight Talk service, which I paid $45.00/month.  With Straight Talk I received great service, never a dropped call or interruption in service.  I presumed all carriers provided the same high quality service.  However, after two weeks of the worst service I had ever experienced I attempted to return the iPhone.  I was told that I had only 14 days to return the phone, and it had been 17 days.  Then I was advised that I had committed to a contract with AT&T at $80.00/month for three years!!!!!  I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  With no way to return the phone or discontinue the AT&T service.  I immediately discontinued the service and returned to a better carrier and gave the phone back to an AT&T electronics salesperson. Now AT&T is billing me for $333.00 for the two weeks of using their service.  I've called AT&T 12 times and visited the AT&T stores without satisfaction.  HELP!  Don't trust the dishonest employees at Walmart being paid by AT&T to push their products on unsuspecting elders.  I was NEVER asked to change service providers or enter into a contract for nearly twice what I've paid for nearly 20 years.  VERY DISCEPTIVE PRACTICE.Date of experience:November 01, 2022",1

I went into the store to purchase an item.I requested $20 cash back while making the payment at the checkout when asked by the payment machine. The elderly Filipino lady wanted to bring out one $20 note. I asked her to please give me $10 and two $5 instead. She was unhappy about this and had a bad attitude. Anyway, she gave me some notes which I held in my hands with the receipt. I  was about to leave the checkout. I then realized she gave me only two $5 notes. So I told her before she started attending to the next customer. This associate stated she gave me $10s instead of $5s and started arguing. The next customer then told her those two 5 dollars were all she gave me. Then she checked the receipt. She did not even apologize for what she did - that she made a mistake and accused me wrongly. Thank God the next customer saw the amount she gave me. It would have been a different story. She then said she had to call someone here before she can get the money out and asked me to wait... So she checked out the next customer.Then a person called Toya, the team leader came to open the cash drawer and the associate gave me $10.I expected her to at least say sorry for her bad attitude which even made her make the mistake in the first place. She never said sorry. So I commented ‘poor customer service.’ The team leader named Toya then said “what did the associate do? It was just a mistake.” I was trying to explain to Toya, the team leader,  but shut me up and would not even listen to me. I asked this girl called Toya if she was there and knew what transpired between the associate and me. She shut me up again and said, “just go.”I was really upset. But I’m not surprised. The team leader even had an attitude, let alone an associate. So ridiculous.

Jenna,1review,US,2022-12-09T01:44:07.000Z,"Pryor, Ok WalmartI’ve been in contact with headquarters and have obtained a reference number given by Walmart Contact Center. I was told to await further responses and I am doing so. Until then I needed to be sure it was made aware by those who should be concerned about my experience. I was denied my medication after explaining my diagnosis of bipolar 1 schizophrenia. I was released by an officer before I completely lost consciousness. My husband had been outside the door with my medication but was refused permission to enter the office where I was being held captive. There’s much more to this matter but the main point I need to make is, you cannot deny someone with severe illnesses of their medication. One employee filed a complaint so I am now expected to pay a $600 fine two days after Christmas. With no proof or evidence of wrongdoing. Even the police officer seemed to be concerned about my health and allowed me and my husband to leave. I now do not trust Walmart to have my best interest in mind. I am bipolar 1 schizophrenic and was not permitted to receive my medication. Walmart in Pryor, Ok. Please educate your employees on any and all illnesses. I’d hate to see something similar to happen to anyone but especially individuals that have worse symptoms than myself. Thank you.Date of experience:November 19, 2022",1

As a replacement I decided to try Walmart, WRONGI ORDERED A SET OF TIRES FOR MY CAR. When they came, I went to the Walmart auto unit in Frederick, MD. My tires were there but the mechanic tells me that he cannot service my type of auto due to problems with the auto lift at his service area. According to him I would have to go to another Walmart to try and get the tires installed (and yes, I had already paid in full for the tires). So, I went to the second Walmart and found the same problem they also could not put my car up on their lift.This Walmart is in Fredrick, MD about 40 miles from my home, so, an 80-miles round trip. The second place they sent me to be another 30 miles from the Frederick store to the second store. So, now I have driven 140 miles with gas at $4.00/ gallon.When I asked to speak to a manager at the Frederick store, I had to wait for over an hour to see her. She was rude as well as belligerent and unhelpful. I was forced to take the car I had bought the tires for to a local gas station and pay $126.00 in addition to what I had already paid Walmart. But more than that I found the employees at both Walmart stores to seem “afraid” and “powerless”…and for that reason I am back to amazon.Date of experience:December 07, 2022",1
Angie Green,1review,US,2022-12-08T20:36:59.000Z,"Bad customer service...My daughter has been having a lot of trouble with the Walmart in Placerville California. Her 2 year old lost his Nike shoe in the parking lot last week. I know that sounds trivial but the real issue is the customer service. After realizing what happened to his shoe just 2 days after it was lost I went to Walmart and they said yes someone turned it in but the customer service counter threw it away. These were new Nike revolution shoes that cost over $50. My daughter does not have the money to replace them. We can not understand why in less than one week of being turned in the shoe would get thrown away. Calling the corporate office has not helped and no one in the Placerville store has been any help at all. We were lucky to have realized where the shoe got lost and very lucky someone turned it in but then Walmart threw it away. All we can get is customer service telling us they threw it away and corporate telling us to talk to the Placerville store. They are just passing it off and no one will offer any resolution not even an apology. Very bad customer service from the corporate office and the Placerville store.Date of experience:December 06, 2022",1

So I called Walmart ""Customer Care"" and was forced to talk to one foreign-based agent after another whom I couldn't understand because of their heavy accents. They also failed to let me know that I had purchased their extended warranty plan so that this failed vacuum was covered under the extended warranty, after they had told me there was nothing they could do about my $400 dead vacuum cleaner. It wasn't until I spent the time to locate the record of my purchase that I saw that this item WAS still covered through the Walmart Extended Warranty that I purchased at the time I bought the vacuum. But now after all this time spent, it is still on me to jump through more hoops to get this piece of junk repaired. Next time for any such future purchases I will just go to Costco where if there's any similar problem, there will be none of this ridiculous and onerous waste of my time because Costco just lets you return defective merchandise without abusing you further for your trouble.

Walmart client’s review,2reviews,US,2022-12-07T22:19:28.000Z,"Unethical sales processBe careful when you shopping with Walmart!Walmart gives you an option to cancel an order placed online. I did order an electronic item but immediately after placed the order I noticed the product added was wrong therefore in less then 3 minutes I cancelled the order and replaced with the right item. However, next day I noticed that the order with the item I cancelled was pushed through anyways. I contacted the customer service by Chat and was told that “everything was taking care of” and I would not need to return the item cancelled and a refund was processed. I followed their own policy! But few days later I received an email with a twisted situation mentioned that an item that was reported lost was tracked and confirmed it was received by me, this was the item cancelled! And they said they would process the payment again from my credit card, what a scam process from Walmart, unethical and disrespectful to the client!I never wanted anything for free from them but they make it look like the client is the bad guy! So I asked for printed return label. I was about to donate the item, and would have to pay for it over $140.  I will complain with NY BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU!It’s an unethical sales process.Also I have experience another shopping issues with them, we order groceries online which is listed  as available for shipping then you pay for the order, but later on they send you an email saying that you got to pick up your order in NJ (but it was listed as available for shipping) this is another unethical sales process with misleading information!

G. Michael Mason,1review,US,2022-12-07T08:26:32.000Z,"The spirit of Sam Walton is still aliveYESTERDAY, WALMART DID IT AGAIN…..              This actually happened to me yesterday.             I informed Walmart+ that I had changed banks and debit/credit cards to boot. I was waiting on physical cards to arrive. So, nicely, they suggested that I take another fifteen days to pay, but I didn’t need quite THAT long. So after thinking about it, I took them up, although I knew that I would pay by Friday, December 9th. Having extra time to pay during Christmas always works!. Fade to Tuesday morning…. While checking my emails and getting ready to do my weekly grocery run, (Yes, my grocery shopping day IS Tuesday) I see an email banner from Walmart descend on my screen and in bold, black letters the words : ‘PAYMENT DECLINED!’ I didnt know what I was reading until I opened the email and saw that , contrary to their promise they tried to charge my membership on card that I no longer have or use.  That’s when it starts to get warm in my room. My anger rose simultaneously with my blood pressure! “WT?!?!” I understand that mistakes happen, but the salt was already in the wound, so to speak. I went into my Walmart account and canceled my Walmart+ trial period quit the program. I’m sure somewhere in my head the words :”I’ll show them!”  were spinning around. I canceled my grocery shopping because I shop for groceries at…..  you guessed it.. Walmart! I wasn’t going to go at all. After cooling down, I decided that maybe I was being a bit sophomoric about this. I realized that I had exhibited a ‘take my ball and go home!’ paradigm. So I wrote Walmart and related my experience. The bot asked if someone from Walmart could call me and I said yes. Within three minutes my phone rang and it WAS Walmart. A gentleman named ‘Muhammad’ spoke to me with a warmth in his voice that was almost palpable. He began the conversation with an apology. That was pure genius! He said that he would have to transfer me to the Customer Care department and assured me that they would take care of me, I thanked him and within forty or fifty SECONDS, a gentleman named ‘Steven’ introduced himself. I related what happened and he listened quietly and after I finished he said: “I’m sure that we can give you an accommodation but remember, you are under no obligation to do as we suggest. I started thinking that I was gonna get an ultimatum or harsh direction and began to regret that I had said anything to anyone at Walmart.  So after a very brief moment, Steven returned and said: “Would it be amenable to you if we extend your free trial out by six months?   If that’s okay with you, your next monthly payment would be due on February 8, 2023. I almost choked! I thought that Steven was talking to someone on another call, because he had to repeat himself due to my total silence. I replied that such a gesture was great, but that was not my reason for calling. I didn’t want anything from Walmart. I just wanted Walmart.com to know that I wasn’t a deadbeat welching on my obligation. He laughed and assured me that such was not the case. Once again, he reiterated that his manager would be quite happy if I decided to take the offer… After thinking about it , I accepted the offer and thanked Steven and his manager profusely. It was then about six fifteen in the evening. I didn’t think twice about my next move. I got my umbrella, my gray and black large Walmart ‘Mandalorean’’ shopping bags and went grocery shopping at Walmart!  And on that trip, I spent more than fifteen times what that monthly payment would have been! These people make service delivery and customer satisfaction like a science!  shopping at Walmart!

I’ve had to call, spend hours on hold, email, and chat to multiple agents. I did all the things I was told to do, none of which have been helpful. One agent told me if I emailed pictures to an email he provided me I would get a refund - he made it sound like that’s all I had to do, but turns out the email is automated and only used for evidence. Aka, I had to call yet again today to try and sort this out. It feels like Walmart makes the process so difficult that people won’t want to do it. They don’t do exchanges, only refunds and I don’t want my money back, I just want the item I bought undamaged. Why they can’t just exchange it is beyond me. Now I have to go in person to return it (because the agent I talked to today couldn’t get ahold of the people he needed to talk to about it which felt really unprofessional) and I’m just so frustrated at this point. It defeats the whole purpose of buying online. I’m so deeply unsatisfied with the whole process, not only is it inconvenient, it was dangerous.

They also refuse to request a return shipment from FedEx, who says they put this restriction on the shipment preventing me from refuing the shipment. Which in turn leaves me waiting over a month for my money or my tiers or any idea if I've been robed or not.

Some items like certain cleaning supplies (vinegar, Spot Shot carpet cleaner) Walmart will not deliver even from nearby stores.  That is another issue because the item has to be in stock at a store near you to be eligible for free shipping.  If you want to search store availability in other areas, you had better know the zip code of said area because walmart.com won't let you search by city name. It's a ridiculously cumbersome process that makes no sense for a company this large.  They have no chance of competing with the likes of Amazon with an outmoded website and distribution/delivery system as it stands.  Having store employees deliver items in their own personal cars is a better idea in theory than in practice as packages are more apt to be delivered to the wrong address or not delivered at all.Date of experience:December 01, 2022",1

Finally he admitted that my order WAS in the system, but since he’s the only worker available, I’d have to come back in the morning when customer service was open and talk to them if I wanted my groceries. I sat and watched other customers getting their orders no problem, proving this to be another lie. Disgraceful. Even though the money had already been taken from my bank account, i was not allowed to get my food and was forced to go home without. I couldn’t even get groceries elsewhere with my money being held hostage.  Do you know what it’s like to be denied food? Food you worked hard to pay for?

Three days after purchasing, the person went out of the country for their studies. When they set the laptop up after their arrival they noticed the laptop took over 3 hours to setup and load.  Assuming since it was their first time turning the device on, the setup would take some time. However, it would take over an hour to load the home screen after turning the computer on.  At that time it was less than 7 days of purchasing and the person contacted HP for assistance.  It required numerous calls, emails, and chats with HP to get assistance with this computer. HP ran a diagnostics on the computer and stated that there was a defect in the computer and it would cost over $300 for them to fix the computer. HP stated that the serial number showed in their system that the device was purchased June 2021 and it was out of warranty.  I then had to submit the online receipt and banking statements to prove to HP that I had purchased the item brand new from walmart August 27, 2022, which took two  weeks of back and forth contact with HP. At that time I reached out to walmart customer service with no success. They claimed the laptop could be returned to any walmart and added an extension to the return window as the device was not in the country.  They emailed me a new return receipt reflecting the new return date. I informed customer service that the original box was discarded and they said that the store did not need a box (which two different phone reps told me). Less than 20 minutes after speaking with a customer service rep. I drove to Walmart store # 3563 to try to do the return.Nobody was at the desk and the area was roped off. Finally an associate walked by and I asked if the desk was closed already and she stated yes because they were closing in 15 minutes. The staff had an attitude when I told her the information from the service center and said she couldn't deal with it and would have to call one of the managers. When the manager came she said that the people I spoke with lied or that I was lying about not needing a box. She said she could override the system's return date if I had the original box with a barcode.  The laptop had all the original plastic coverings, booklets and everything that it came with but she said without a box for electronics they don't take back. I was told to tell the manager to contact the service system to see their notes about accepting the return with the new return-by date.The manager laughed and said there was no such thing and that they were closing in 15 minutes and asked why didn't I just purchase the walmart warranty. Why would anyone buy a warranty for an item that was defective and would be returned? Overall, this was the worst purchase I've ever made.

It all started when I placed an order that was $4 less than $5,000. I received all my items but 1 that was $1439. When I got home I contacted Walmart.com as that is where I ordered it from and was told to wait 24-48 hours. I waited and still nothing so contacted them back and was told it would be delivered on November 25. Well here it is and still nothing. They told me to contact the seller in which I did. The seller requested all this information in which I provided just to send me a message November 29th to take it up with fed ex. WOW 😮 Walmart told me that there is nothing they could do and dispute with my bank. Well tried that but being I paid one payment to Walmart.com my bank can only dispute the full charge which is not what I want to do. After letting Walmart know this I have been hung up on multiple times after being placed on hold for 1-3:30 hours just for no resolution and the lost of my money. In this same order I received 6 items that I started the return on the app and was to take to the store. This was November 26 and when I get to the store I’m told they can only take 2 no problem. They took the two but I can’t cancel the return on the other 4 and neither can they as it is a glitch in the system. After multiple attempts and being transferred and on hold for 1:30-3:30 hours the so called 3 supervisors hung up as I’m assuming they thought I would. Still no resolution and the store actually sent the items back to me so I still have six items I don’t need and would like to return. November 30 which is today I was on hold place by a supervisor for 30 mins then she hung up.

I was excited to find a 75 inch Samsung on Walmart.com. I ordered it on my lunch break and paid with Affirm payments. By the time I got off work, Walmart had CANCELLED MY ORDER. I was stuck. I could not order another one because I chose payments and I needed payments. So even though I looked it up and it could still be ordered online, the Walmart customer service could not help me. They offered me the same price later, but how do I trust that? When would I get my TV? I asked them to send an email stating that I could get it for that price later and was told no. Really? I ended up at Amazon paying more, but at least I got it and with payments. Never again Walmart. I don't trust you anymore.Date of experience:November 28, 2022",1

Matt H.,1review,US,2022-11-27T22:38:01.000Z,"Do Not Buy Phones From Walmart - Their Phone Employees are CrooksI purchased a Straight Talk phone at Walmart in Henrietta NY. The purchase with the woman behind the counter went great, she was very nice.Then the actual cell phone worker for Walmart came back right after I paid. He got upset because he wasn't the one who run up the phone and then tried to convince me that I needed to return it and then buy it with him. I of course did not, because I wasn't going to have the phone, otter box, screen protector, and extra insurance charged twice to my account.Within a few days this Samsun A53 device I purchased began blaring a loud beep when I tried to charge it. The device refused to charge until the port was ""Cleaned"" even though it was incredibly clean because it was brand new. This got so bad that I called Samsung and they referred me to a place in Pittsford NY called ""UbreakIFix"" which they said would fix it under the manufacturer's warranty.I went to UBreakIFix and they said they needed to order a new part and to come back. I went back two weeks later to have them install the part and not only did they never order the part, they said they were unable to work on the phone at all because it was a Straight Talk phone.I called Samsung back and told them what happened and that the issue has now gotten so bad that the phone immediately SMOKES as soon as a charger is plugged in. They said they would refund me my money however I want (mentioned PayPal specifically) and then put me on hold for a long time. When they came back on the line they casually said ""Oh... it's a Straight Talk phone?"". I go, it's a Straight Talk phone in the sense that they provide the service, but Samsung makes the phone. They transferred me to Straight Talk without saying anything, just straight pushed me away.Then Yani Lynn with Straight Talk refused to let me speak with her manager, saying they don't do that. They refused to refund me my money even though I already bought a new phone to replace the one that could potentially burn my entire apartment building down. Why would I want another Samsung A53? Why? Samsung has done nothing but send me on a wild goose chase, completely wasting my time and money. So now I can't return the phone to Walmart because it's been past 14 days (less than two months though), even though I paid $55 for insurance at the time of purchase Straight Talk is only willing to send me another Samsung A53 that they wouldn't confirm if it was already used or not (they said it would be whatever they have in their ""Warehouse""... Stop. Just stop with that nonsense, just tell me you don't know).My total cost for the phone, insurance, glass protector, case, and tax was $381.00. I work my regular job 45 hours a week and I run a 501(c)3 in my free time. All together, I work a minimum of 85 hours a week, but in all honesty is usually more. I can't be without a phone and every minute that I'm not able to be working on the nonprofit is time that takes away from those we serve. This has been an absolutely awful experience all the way around and I wish Walmart didn't get as much business as they do because their process, refund policy, and partnerships are literal trash.Date of experience:October 08, 2022",1

We place three orders in the past 6 months and didn't receive our packages AT ALL! We live in a remote area and can see and hear any car that even turns onto our road, much less our driveway. We were home every time and no delivery truck came anywhere near our street or home. Walmart states they use a third party delivery person - if so, they are being scammed big time. Our latest order was 2000106-02426238 and we received a text that it was delivered. Nope. Same thing with a few days ago, order 2000105-34344261. Walmart thinks they can just issue a refund and that's all they need to do. We received a bizarre email from the seller (Papillon Shades) that read, ""The item is delivered to your address but you didn't receive the item, We are a customer like you and we know it was very harassing for everyone... we hope you receive it in 1-3 business days"". What??? They are a customer like me? No, dumb ass, you are a seller and you should find a delivery like FedEx or UPS that comes to our house EVERY DAY and manages to actually delivery our packages. The third package was this past summer, order 4042202-244565 and it was for an expensive television. It never came and we had to reorder it and pay an extra $100!!!!

Caveat emptor. If you can get what you’re after somewhere else for close to the same price, I’d do it. If you need some kind of interaction, Amazon’s customer service is excellent.

Two different delivery guys, both guys left the items by the front door of my machine shop. Never attempted to open the door and leave anything with the receptionist. Left them right in front of the building on a busy street. Suffice to say I did not receive either item by the time I got outside. I drove all the way to the Walmart store which initiated the delivery which was almost an hour away from my shop. Told them what happened they pretty much assumed zero responsibility for the issue and told me to contact Uber eats. I contacted Uber eats and they told me it was an issue with walmart. I contacted my credit card company to dispute both charges and they said I had to wait 10 days.

In May of 2022 my account was fraudulently used to place an order to be delivered to a residence in Florida, I had saved my CC in the Walmart app and promptly removed my info, contacted Walmart and they canceled this order and reimbursed me.  I changed my payment option to PayPal and have had no issues until this past weekend.  Someone in Pflungerville, TX used my Walmart account fraudulently 8 times in the course of 2 days.  Called Walmart customer service ( which is outsourced to another country) and for 25 grueling minutes I tried to get this resolved to no end.  I finally called my bank and had the matter resolved, however, after researching the two addresses they tried to have the items shipped to, there appears to be 22 known addresses for this POS and 2 of the 22 is where they are having it sent to. According to my bank they will investigate this fraud but cannot proceed in criminal charges, BUT YOU CAN.  I have filed a police report with the Cyber Crime Dept at my local Police Department and suggest that anyone else that has been a victim of this type of fraud contact your local Police Department and do the same.  This is obviously some sort of theft ring and they need to brought to justice!  The states this individual has addresses in are in TX, MA, VA and CA. I highly recommend that you DO NOT store any payment option in the Walmart app, they take zero responsibility for the inability to be a secure shopping site!Date of experience:November 20, 2022",1

I have video and camera images proving no one attempted delivery at my address on the days stated. The last straw occurred today, Walmart sent me a notification that my order was delivered. This order was already delayed several days despite being a Walmart plus member. However that’s not the worst part when I looked at the image of the delivery I thought well there’s no way that’s three. My order was for three large ninja kitchen systems. I will attach a image showing the comparison of what Walmart left. It’s obvious this is the new scam inside of Walmart say something was delivered and keep the item or money. I’m not sure if it’s stemming from the employees or management probably both! Management when they don’t have the product in house and employees when they have decided to not deliver something and keep it. The sad part is instead of Walmart investigating the problem they instead blame the customer. I spent all day trying to resolve this problem dealing with incompetence and indifference. I spoke to Edgar from the account services team, I requested he look at the proof of delivery image and compare it to a ninja.kitchen system box it’s clearly not. Instead of having any concern or desire to get to the truth Edgar instead continued with his accusatory tone. If he wanted to solve the problem the comparison was the easier way. However this department isn’t trying to solve anything especially when it points towards Walmart. Edgar’s main goal was to blame me the customer. He had the audacity to question why I canceled other orders. That’s laughable as the orders were delayed for a week. Why should I have to continue to wait for my orders when Walmart plus members are supposed to first? Walmart plus is broken and instead of fixing it they blame customers!

What we received was only 8"" tall and not a poodle and advertised for $29.95 (WB369). The delivery to the store took 2 weeks, so when I went to pick up my order and realized it was wrong, the birthday was now only a few days away. I contacted support and they wanted me to return the wrong puppet, and once they receive it then they would send me the correct puppet. I explained that I didn't have time for all of that, and I would just use what I was sent as the gift, and they could just credit me the difference of $47.00. I even sent pictures to show their error for proof, yet they refuse to issue me a credit. I called this 3rd party business, Virventures, many times about this issue and they say it's a Walmart issue and someone from Walmart will contact me. I am still waiting for that phone call. And now they tell me in an email that the deadline for returning the puppet has passed so I am out the $47 cash and stuck with this cheaper puppet.

Nowlin, M.A.12807 Cara DriveWoodbridge, VA  22192571-408-4880I met Sam Walton when I was 11 years old in Bentonville, Arkansas when my older brother Andy was trying to get a job driving one of Sam's trucks.  When he spoke to my brother, I listened very closely to what was said by Sam.  Sam said first that he would only buy, haul, and sell products made in the USA.  Then he said that his employees were required to speak only English in the stores and on the docks, and never anything but English around customers.  Today, November 12, 2022, at approximately 1300 hours, I was shopping at the Walmart store in Woodbridge, Virginia and was checking out when the Pakistani cashier, Ahmed, who didn't even acknowledge my presence, began jabbering away to another employee in a foreign language while looking at me with a strange expression.  I asked him if he was talking about me?  Instead of saying yes or no he replied, ""Is your name Rasha, or something like that name.""  I replied, ""I don't speak that language.  and it was very rude for you to speak that language in my presence.""  Ahmed smirked and shrugged and said, ""I'll speak in any language I want to speak in.""  I then demanded to speak to the Front-end Manager and was instead directed someone, a woman, called a coach, named"" Tehreew, or something else pretty close to that spelling.  I had lodged a previous complaint about employees speaking foreign languages around customer with a previous Front-end Manager, a white lady named Marjorie, about 15 months earlier, and I mentioned her to this Tehreew.  Marjorie had agreed with me that such behavior by employees was very rude.  I said this to Tehreew and told her that the employees were free to speak their own languages at home and off-work, but not in the workplace.  She was wearing a facemask so I couldn't see the sneering expression she was probably showing, and I asked told her what Sam Walton had said and what Marjorie had said and asked her is that wasn't reasonable.  She had the gall to say out of her mask that it wasn't reasonable to required Walmart employees to speak English.  I then told her that I would be report her to Walmart Corporate today, and I told her that I hoped that she was fired for her unreasonable and objectionable attitude, for it was apparent that she presumed that she and Ahmed could insult Walmart customers with impunity.  I have no idea is Walmart Corporate reads these complaints, but they should realize that insulted customers will stop shopping at Walmart and go to other stores.  Safeway, Albertsons, Alpha-Beta, Food Lion, Giant, Wegmans, and Harris Teeter are much better-run stores than Walmart.  Sam Walton is probably looking down from the spirit-world sadly shaking his head at what socialistic unamerican immigrants have done to his great enterprise since his death.I am 70 years of age and retired as a certified paralegal from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs with a graduate degree in the behavioral and social sciences from U.T.

The service needs to be revamped or just done away with all together.I am a disabled veteran who is also a retired Master Chef that loves to still cook for myself, friends and family.  And I order online for this delivery service every month because I don't drive and can't get out to shop.  I've hundreds of dollars of my fixed income in hopes that I would receive what I paid for at the time that I chose.But every time I order either part of my order is substituted for something I don't want. Part of my order is left out, damaged or all 3 discrepancies at once!  Yeah sometimes they often give me promo code discounts. But it doesn't really help you too much when you've already spent all your money and still only have half the ingredients you need for a recipe or dish you have to cook.Today really took the cake though. I ordered over $200 worth of groceries to be delivered between 8-9pm.  At about 8:40pm I get a text that my order is delayed and might take up to 2 hours to be delivered. I call to see what's going on and the delivery rep told me that the driver decline the delivery. But as I talked to her I got a notification that 6 items would be substituted.  So the rep had flat out just lied to me. Because my order allegedly was still being prepared.So two hours and 18 minutes go by and it still delayed and no response. ( I later found out the store was closed by then.)  But I had had enough by then and called in and totally canceled my order.  I'm too old to be waiting up all night to be delivered and put away groceries.I'm never doing this again because it too stressful, unpredictable and embarrassing.

I got an email that they were delivered but they were not with the bellhop. I then spent hours and hours on the phone with customer service who told me that I signed for them so no refund could be issued or my order be resent. I had even asked in the notes for the driver to call or text me so I could meet him downstairs and that never happened. He must have signed for me and stole our stuff?? It was over 400 dollars worth of groceries and some alcohol  which took a big chunk out of our spending money for the trip. Walmart  uses a third party to deliver but won’t give you any info on what company so you can investigate what happened. I don’t know how they expected me to prove I didn’t sign if they won’t give me the information I need to sort it out.  This was so stressful and a waste of our vacation time. Luckily for me, I called the actual Walmart in Anaheim and spoke to the team lead Jose Cruz ( not sure spelling)who was amazingly helpful. He saw that the “signature” was just a line and also told me this happened before. I tried calling customer service again with that information and they still told me I was out of luck. I called Jose back again and he went above and beyond by calling customer service for me and managed to get my refund. He spent a long time on the phone with them too. He is the only reason I gave more than one star, I still can’t believe how helpful he was to me, a complete stranger! I will never forget his kindness, but also will never order from Walmart.com again either, unless maybe I pick up myself.

Now, their drivers just don’t deliver, when they don’t feel like it. The excuse:  “We couldn’t deliver your order”, which is a lie, since I’ve been receiving Walmart orders for almost four years now. Apparently, their drivers don’t want to bother with deliveries anymore, so why is Walmart taking online orders???You don’t get anywhere with Walmart outsourced “customer help”! Ordering online is supposed to make life easier, NO longer the case with Walmart: I still don’t know when, if, I will ever receive my November 8 order!Date of experience:November 08, 2022",1

I tried to support Walmart more than Amazon because I felt like Amazon is a garbage company but Walmart started becoming saturated with the same third-party vendor junk that even now, I'm having trouble deciphering what's decent quality and what's not.Just recently, I purchased a decor item from a third-party vendor who gave me a fake tracking number and for 3 weeks, I didn't get the item. I contacted the vendor twice to get clarification and they just copy and pasted me some generic response. I had to contact Walmart directly to cancel the order and get a refund.Then, I subscribed to Walmart+ for several months and everything was fine until I noticed they were billing me erratically and not on appropriate monthly basis. Sometimes they charged me twice a month. I cancelled my subscription back in July 2022 and my account has no active subscription. Yet, I was continuously charged for 4 months after that so I contacted Walmart and spoke to 4 agents being told they have no idea what the charges were. I had to contact my CC company who confirmed it was definitely Walmart and I had to dispute all 4 months worth of charges to get my money back.I like Walmart and I want to support them over Amazon but they make it so difficult especially when the website isn't as friendly, and there's sooo many sketchy third-party vendors. This is becoming so annoying that I started to shop at Target more often.Date of experience:November 10, 2022",3

Bill Levinson,1review,US,2024-02-10T18:37:08.000Z,"The Wilkes-Barre store (store 01623) has multiple problems.The Wilkes-Barre store (store 01623) keeps dumping my orders in whatever doorway it finds convenient rather than at my address. This has happened multiple times, I have told them about it multiple times, and it happened again today. In fact, my delivery instructions that cited this issue were ignored and they just dumped my order at somebody else's address. (In fairness to the store, they use a third party delivery service, but this third party is clearly not up to a job that the USPS, Amazon, UPS, and so on perform right 99.9 percent of the time.)The store itself shows a total lack of pride by those who run it (my perception based on my negative experience). (1) The web site showed Equate witch hazel to be in stock at this store but, when I went there, it was out of stock. (2) There was no price tag, at least none I could find, under the nearby name brand. Do these people bother to put price tags on their shelves? (3) There were plastic slides over aspirin that serve no apparent purpose, and the directions to slide them to one side are worthless because similar slides block you from doing it. All they accomplish is to compel the customer to wrench and twist the desired items past them to buy them. (4) The shaving items were in a locked case so I assume this store does not want anybody to buy them (I noticed this but was not shopping for one). I try to avoid going into this store, and now I remember why.I was also told that the store cannot re-deliver the order that was dumped at the wrong address, so I asked for a refund and will buy the item from somebody else. Not only do they screw up the deliveries, they can't even be bothered to make them right.UPDATE Feb. 10 2024  Delivery performance seems to have improved. I got a couple of orders at the correct address, with none at some other address, so I have changed the rating from 1 to 2 stars.Date of experience:November 06, 2022",2

Also I’m going to suggest to the otc provider to remove Walmart as a service. Doubt they will, but I’m still going to make the suggestion. Besides playing craps IF I get my order? When I do they pretty much just send me whatever they please. And ya, GOOD LUCK with trying to contact the store to see where the eff is the order. Unfortunately, I am at Walmarts mercy since I don’t have a vehicle to shop elsewhere and this pot luck business accepts my benefits.

Lou,2reviews,US,2022-11-08T20:10:00.000Z,"Dystopian Corporation Owned by Rich TyrantsWalmart is proving that America became a developing country totalitarianistically ruining everything for oligarchs' greed. Walmart promotes dehumanizing work environments for employees barely affording rent while very rich stockholders live in owned houses and ride on yachts during inflation, recessions, layoffs, etc. caused by oligarchs hijacking the economy to extort their wealth when everyone else suffers. Also, Walmart usually has some damaged products like crackers inside boxes before customers buy them when drivers do not carefully drive and put items in warehouses. Walmart relies on environmentally unsustainable planned obsolescence that contributes to climate change, wasting nonrenewable resources, and harming the ecosystem when species are going extinct. Walmart financially supports unethical business practices like child slavery when children get cobalt responsible for making smartphones overseas. It's just proving America's leaders care about power and money to unethically control people rather than justice. There is no justice when lower-class people are being enslaved to greedy tyrants. Walmart's stockholders make sure that America's public schools are intentionally broken to keep working class Americans as easily indoctrinated soldiers for the profitable war crime machine that keeps America's oligarchs richer than everyone else who suffers or dies. So, Walmart is financially supporting war criminals who control America's ruthless empire of profitable warmongering. Profitable oil wars that make innocent women and children murdered by patriarchs overseas are a reason why Americans can still pump their vehicles with gas in America. It's also why America is still a racist patriarchy controlled by upper-class, white men. I'm just saying all of these because Walmart is controlled by greedy tyrants who made America become a developing country because of their extorted wealth while everyone else suffers or dies. Walmart even financially supports these rich tyrants who keep Hispanic and black people unfairly incarcerated in their tyrannical prison systems. Like I said. It's a racist patriarchy. It's also a situation where poor and disabled people get treated like afterthoughts from Walmart's dystopian business. I hope activists fight against America's rich tyrants and this dystopian Walmart corporation that unsurprisingly has horrible customer support service.Date of experience:March 07, 2022",1

Lastly the chat agent just leaves the conversation when complaining about the missing refund. What a scam.Date of experience:November 02, 2022",1

They don't give an single damn about the delivery time you book and do absolutely nothing to compensate.And if you call customer service, prepare to be hung up on if you have more than a basic query. clearly a ""not my problem"" culture there. I'm yet to have a single good experience with Walmart. truly awful serviceDate of experience:November 02, 2022",1
Dale Brocskmith,5reviews,US,2022-11-03T01:23:00.000Z,"Worst experience ever I went there to get some paintI went there to get some paint. I stood there waiting for over 37 minutes. I asked three associates to get somebody to help me no one never showed up. But in the meantime, I helped three people in the paint department and tool department find what they were looking for. This is way unacceptable so I left everything else I was going to buy there in the cart walked out of that store and went to Menards and bought my paint and other things. It's just like when i called the store one time it rang over 72 times and I know that because I quit counting. No one never did answer for the phone. What has  happened to employee customer relations because Walmart sure he'll don't have it no more. I do know from other experiences and places I've worked if that phone rang over three times you were in serious trouble or fired. And this just isn't the Quincy Illinois store. The same thing goes to the Hannibal Mo store to. I remember back employees went out of their way to ask you if they can help you and I used to choose Walmart over everything but not anymore. Its sad that a store manager can turn his back and let his employees over run the store. And to think what they make an hour now plus benefits. It seems that since their wages have taken a major hike they can get away with doing less. Real sad that it has come to thisDate of experience:October 31, 2022",1

When I think I have done grocery shopping online for pick up, they dont have half the stuff. The main thing is the last 3 times I have declined something at pick up, I ask can you remove it, and of course i hear yes, and nope days later i am still charged and have to i have to contact customer service and wait 10 days for a refund.

Yasmin McEwen,3.6K reviews,US,2023-04-23T04:14:08.000Z,"Employee Physically/Verbally threatened me today.Edit: April 22, 2023. I was once again simply standing in line waiting for a self checkout to open when a Walmart Employee practically raced up to me the second she saw me-she yelled at me Angry-her Green eyes bulging out and yelled""What Do You Want! Why are you here!"" I was terrified. She caused a big scene. They always do. Her partner the old woman w/all grey hair was with her allowing all of the abuse. She also yelled at me for no reason. I pointed to the checkouts. She got up in my face yelling and being Angry at me for no reason. I went to a checkout and began checking out. I scanned an allergy med. I turned around and that woman was standing directly behind me with her hand in the shape of a Handgun. She pointed that Pistol directly AT MY FACE AND PRETENDED TO SHOOT ME! That Wal-mart Employee is allowed to Pretend to Shoot Me in the Face in front of everyone AND VIOLENTLY YELL AT ME.I ended up calling the Police.What is being done to force me to not even leave my Home is treacherous!The threats will not stop. The Walmart employees yelling at me-singling me out-for NO Reason. Accusing me of Stealing. Treating me like they hate my guts. And they clearly do. I tried to call Walmart -again they made me talk to a NonEnglish speaking VERY RUDE PERSON. I was again followed home by a man in an ALL RED HUGE PICKUP. HE FOLLOWS ME EVERYWHERE AND HAS FOR MANY YEARS. EVEN CUTTING ME OFF AND YELLING AT ME IN TRAFFIC. HE STALKS ME ALL OVER TOWN 😭😭😭😭😭😭.These people in the Town where I live who are systematically abusing me and refusing to let me buy groceries at Walmart. I have put $100 into Walmart cash registers and been told that I still have not paid for my groceries. ""Don't you still need to Pay?"" ""I just paid. You stood here and watched me pay with a brand new $100.00"". ""Don't you have a SPARK Order!"" I do not know what that is and noone will tell me. I have been told SO many times that I did not check or scan an item or Pay for my groceries. Told that I have a SPARK ORDER-when I don't even know what that means. An older woman ehite w/all grey hair walmart employee is allowed to pick me out every single time she sees me and she physically gets in my face and yells at me publicly humiliating me and harassing me causing a scene over nothing. I wear a Mask and she knows I have Cancer and she still gets in my face and Yells at me! She yells at me while I simply stand in line to PAY FOR MY GROCERIES. Other people come up and try to tell me that I need to ""use the smaller one""-while I am patiently quietly waiting for a large checkout station since I have a full cart. I get bullied in these stores oftentimes by older women shoppers who refuse to let me get my 1 item they are standing directly in front of for minutes at a time and they aren't buying any of those items just BLOCKING ME FROM GETTING MY GROCERIES.I have CANCER!I have tried so hard to just buy FOOD TO LIVE and that employee is allowed to yell at me constantly and be cruel to me every week.I am systematically being FORCED OUT OF ALL STORES IN THE TOWN WHERE I LIVE AND NOT ALLOWED TO SURVIVE DUE TO SEVERE DISCRIMINATION.I AM A PERSON TOO!The only time ANY manager ever calls me and they are not kind. Is literally the exact time I am going in to SURGERY TO HAVE MY BODY OPERATED ON.The only time Walmart will ever contact me is at the exact time I am checking in to the local hospital to have surgery.They have messed up my car the day before Major Surgery and refused to simply fix my car what I PAID THEM TO DO.When I try to use my Credit Cards at Walmart they say:MALFUNCTION. PAY WITH CASH ONLYLast week that same lady started yelling at me and the machine she surpervises would only put $8. on my Card when I had $42. At customer Service a nice lady helped me and Big Surprise!-- all my cards Work just fine!I feel Afraid and so alone in the Town where I live due to the constant harassment and stalking and controlling and DESTRUCTION OF MY VERY LIFE DUE TO THESE PEOPLE.THEY WILL NOT STOP HURTING ME!As usual CORPORATE WALMART DOES NOT HELP ME.NOT EVER.No one should ever have to endure Physical and Verbal threats from Walmart Employees. I do not deserve their Cruelty.Date of experience:October 24, 2022",1
